Objectives
The growing shortage of rheumatologists threatens rheumatology care. Patient self-assessment and asynchronous virtual visits may improve efficiency. This study assessed the concordance of face-to-face (F2F) and virtual visit-based treatment decisions in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), incorporating patient self-assessment.
Methods
This prospective 3-month multicentre trial recruited RA patients across 4 university centres in Germany. Patients used a medical app to document the results of a self-performed C-reactive protein (CRP) test, joint count, therapeutic suggestions, and electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) before their regular F2F consultations and ePROs on a weekly basis in-between consultations. Independent tele-rheumatologists provided treatment recommendations based on these data. The primary outcome was the level of agreement between tele-rheumatologists and patients on treatment decisions (escalation, unchanged, de-escalation), compared with F2F rheumatologistsâ€™ decisions. Secondary outcomes included change in patient activation (Patient Activation Measure [PAM]) and in patient-perceived ability to assess their disease activity.
Results
A total of 208 consultations and 114 patients (80.7% female, mean age 51.6 years) were included. Most often (63%), treatment remained unchanged, whereas 24% required escalation and 14% de-escalation. F2F treatment decisions aligned with tele-rheumatologist decisions in 77% of cases and patient suggestions in 67% of cases. The accuracy of tele-rheumatologist decisions was 77% for maintaining treatment, 87% for de-escalation, and 91% for escalation. No significant changes in patient activation and patientsâ€™ ability to assess their disease activity were observed.
Conclusions
The study demonstrated substantial agreement between virtual asynchronous and F2F treatment decisions. However, further refinement of asynchronous care models and validation studies is crucial.}

    abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)â€“assisted ambient documentation technologies that use audio from clinic visits to generate documentation are being deployed across hospital systems to optimize clinical note writing and reduce administrative burden. However, little is known about optimal approaches to engage patients in informed consent for these tools.To explore clinician and patient experiences with consent processes and examine the association between the use of ambient documentation tools and the patient-clinician relationship.This study was conducted from March 1 to December 31, 2024, in ambulatory practices across specialties in a large urban academic health center as part of an ongoing operational quality improvement initiative. Participants included clinicians and patients participating in an operational proof-of-concept exploration of ambient documentation technology.A pragmatic, sequential, inductive-deductive qualitative evaluation was conducted of informed consent contexts, processes, and challenges among ambulatory clinicians and patients exposed to ambient documentation technology. Evaluation included site visits, clinical observations, clinician interviews, and patient surveys to explore perceptions and challenges related to consent.A total of 121 ambient documentation pilot users included 18 clinicians (mean [SD] years of practice, 18.6 [100]; 10 men [55.6\%]) and 103 patients (mean [SD] age, 37 [12.5] years; 65 women [63.1\%]). The most common consent approach was a verbal patient-clinician conversation prior to an individual encounter. Patients and clinicians had a spectrum of comfort with ambient technology; 77 patients (74.8\%) reported being comfortable or very comfortable with their physician using ambient documentation. Patient trust, detail in the consent discussion, and intended tool use were associated with patient comfort and intent to consent. Technical understanding was associated with comfort with consent conversations: when provided basic information about the technology, 84 patients (81.6\%) consented; this decreased to 57 patients (55.3\%) when details about AI features, data storage, and corporate involvement were disclosed. Perceived benefits included reduced documentation burden, improved decision-making, and enhanced communication. Concerns included data security, legal liability, cognitive impacts, and equity. When asked about responsibility for medical errors linked to ambient documentation, 66 patients (64.1\%) held physicians accountable; for data security breaches, 79 patients (76.7\%) believed vendors should be responsible. Participants suggested a flexible consent model with digital touchpoints, education, nonclinical staff support, and opt-out options.In this quality improvement study of 121 pilot users of AI-assisted ambient documentation technology, informed consent relied primarily on verbal conversations that varied based on time, knowledge, and the patient-clinician relationship. A flexible, multimodal approachâ€”including education, time to discuss risks and benefits, digital resources, nonclinical staff involvement, and clear opt-out optionsâ€”may improve consent processes and support broader acceptance of ambient documentation tools.},

abstract="Background: The integration of digital health solutions (DHSs) into health care systems has the potential to significantly enhance service delivery and health outcomes. Despite their benefits, the adoption remains slow, especially in outpatient care, and is hindered by various barriers, such as unclear effectiveness and high costs. Objective: This study aimed to address the uncertainties regarding the cost-benefit ratio of DHSs by developing a comprehensive instrument to evaluate their impact on health care service quality across diverse settings (eg, across different diseases or types of DHSs). Methods: We conducted a multistaged rapid review and semistructured, qualitative interviews to identify and adapt existing instruments evaluating the effects of DHSs. The first rapid review screened 4957 records and included 40 relevant papers to identify instruments currently used for DHS assessment after their deployment, yielding a total of 126 reported outcomes. Subsequently, we conducted interviews with 19 health care practitioners across 4 countries to validate and refine the 7 health care service quality dimensions derived from merging the Outpatient Experience Questionnaire (OPEQ), selected after the first rapid review, and Health Care Service Quality (HEALTHQUAL), an established instrument for measuring health care service quality derived from gray literature. On the basis of the results of the interviews, a second rapid review with 35 papers out of 493 screened records was conducted to identify instruments used to measure patient satisfaction, yielding a total of 29 patient satisfaction instruments. Results: From the first rapid review, OPEQ was selected out of 18 relevant instruments identified among the 126 reported outcomes and combined with HEALTHQUAL. The interviews with health care professionals confirmed the relevance of all 7 health care service quality dimensions derived from OPEQ and HEALTHQUAL. In addition, 4 interviewees mentioned patient satisfaction as a further dimension missing in the framework presented during the interviews. From the subsequent rapid review, the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form was selected out of 6 relevant instruments identified among the 29 identified patient satisfaction instruments. By combining HEALTHQUAL, OPEQ, and Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form, we derived the Digital Healthcare Service Quality (DigiHEALTHQUAL) questionnaire, which consists of 51 items across 8 dimensions, including accessibility, efficiency, empathy, general satisfaction, degree of improvements of care services, information, safety, and tangibles. Conclusions: The DigiHEALTHQUAL questionnaire aims to provide a standardized approach for assessing the impact of DHSs on health care service quality across various use cases, therapeutic areas, and perspectives, facilitating comparison between DHSs and supporting decision makers in resource allocation and implementation decisions. Future research will focus on validating the DigiHEALTHQUAL in real-life settings and further refining it to comprehensively encompass both patient and health care practitioner perspectives. ",

abstract="Background: COVID-19 has given impetus to an already growing trend around the use of ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies to support frail older adults who live alone. However, the challenge is that systematic research on the long-term use of AAL technologies remains in its nascent stages, leaving gaps in the understanding of the predictors that contribute to the routine embedding of AAL technologies in older adults' care. Objective: This paper aims to share key lessons from a longitudinal study on the routine embedding of AAL technologies in older adults' care within a hitherto under-studied Southeast Asian context. Our objective was to design and deploy an AAL system termed Ubiquitous Service Management and Reasoning Architecture (Ubismart), evaluate its impact on older adults' quality of life (QOL), and distill lessons to inform the sustainable and culturally sensitive adoption of AAL technologies in similar settings. Methods: We conducted an in-depth case study using a mixed methods design. First, we designed and deployed Ubismart to unobtrusively monitor and visualize older adults' activities of daily living. To assess changes in QOL, we administered a simplified, gamified version of the validated Older People's Quality of Life Questionnaire. Finally, we conducted semistructured interviews with older adults and their caregivers to triangulate the quantitative findings and explore evolving perceptions of the technology and its integration into daily routines. Results: Quantitative analysis revealed significant improvements in (1) psychological and emotional well-being (P=.01) and (2) leisure and social activities (P=.03) following the AAL intervention. Other QOL dimensions showed no statistically significant change. Qualitative findings reinforced the improvement in psychological and emotional well-being, with many participants describing a heightened sense of safety and peace of mind, often likening the technology to ``insurance'' or a silent companion. However, the impact on social relationships was paradoxical; some older adults felt more cared for, while others perceived a decline in in-person visits. This paradox highlighted the complexities of technology's role in caregiving, as it might simultaneously enhance feelings of safety while unintentionally diminishing social connection for some older adults. Conclusions: AAL technologies such as Ubismart enhance older adults' psychological and emotional well-being and sense of safety but may inadvertently reduce social interaction. Sustainable integration requires balancing these benefits with efforts to maintain meaningful caregiver connections, supporting both safety and social engagement for older adults.

    abstract = { Canada’s initial attempt at AI governance, the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA), was introduced within Bill C-27, but was ultimately terminated with the prorogation of Parliament in January 2025. AIDA sought to establish a risk-based regulatory framework; however, it was criticized for its lack of specificity, underinclusiveness, and absence of sector-specific oversight — issues that are particularly consequential for health care AI applications. The broad and generalized nature of AIDA left regulatory gaps concerning safety, bias, transparency, and patient privacy in AI-driven medical decision-making. In this article, we analyze the shortcomings of AIDA in health care AI governance and propose key reforms to guide future legislative efforts. A targeted, sector-specific approach is essential to ensure AI’s safe and effective integration into health care while fostering responsible innovation. The Canadian experience provides important lessons for global AI regulation, particularly in balancing technological progress with patient safety and ethical considerations. This commentary examines the shortcomings of Canada’s proposed Artificial Intelligence and Data Act, in particular its failure to adequately provide regulatory guidance for health care AI. It argues for a more targeted, sector-specific approach to ensure patient safety, transparency, and responsible innovation in future AI legislation. }

To identify the utilization of shared medical notes, referred to as â€œopen notes,â€ and the experience of caregivers and cardiology providers during inpatient hospitalization for congenital heart disease.
Study design
Single-center, cross-sectional, survey-based study utilizing convenience sampling of patient caregivers on a pediatric acute care cardiology unit and corresponding cardiology providers. Surveys assessed demographic information, health literacy of caregivers, and experiences during inpatient hospitalization that relate to open note use. Descriptive statistics were performed.
Results
Forty-five caregivers (47% of eligible) and 21 cardiology providers (100% of eligible) were enrolled. There were no demographic differences between caregivers, or their children, who were open notes vs nonopen notes users (P > .05). Most caregivers were aware that the notes were available (87%), yet fewer enrolled in the program to read them (71%). Most caregivers had positive experiences with the notes (85%), while cardiology providers' opinions were overall neutral or negative (65%). Cardiology providersâ€™ suggestions for improvement of open notes were frequently infeasible based on regulations required by the 21st Century Cures Act.
Conclusions
Open notes in inpatient subspecialty pediatrics yields a novel opportunity for caregivers to engage positively and actively with the care team. Cardiology providers may value how positively caregivers view open notes as a method of receiving medical information and interacting with the care team. Cardiology providers may also benefit from further education on the new legislation in the 21st Century Cures Act.}

abstract="Background: The historical development and contemporary instances of futures studies, an interdisciplinary field that focuses on exploring and formulating alternative futures, exemplify the increasing significance of using futures methods in shaping the health care domain. Despite the wide array of these methodologies, there have been limited endeavors to employ them within the medical community thus far. Objective: We undertook the first scoping review to date about the application of futures methodologies and published foresight projects in health care. Methods: Through the use of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) method, we identified 59 studies that were subsequently categorized into the following 5 distinct themes: national strategies (n=19), strategic health care foresight (n=15), health care policy and workforce dynamics (n=6), pandemic preparedness and response (n=7), and specialized medical domains (n=12). Results: Our scoping review revealed that the application of futures methods and foresight has been successfully demonstrated in a wide range of fields, including national strategies, policy formulation, global threat preparedness, and technological advancements. The results of our review indicate that a total of 8 futures methods have already been used in medicine and health care, while there are more than 50 futures methods available. It may underscore the notion that the field is unexploited. Furthermore, the absence of structured methodologies and principles for employing foresight and futures techniques in the health care domain warrants the creation of medical futures studies as a separate scientific subfield within the broad domains of health care, medicine, and life sciences. This subfield would focus on the analysis of emerging technological trends, the evaluation of policy implications, and the proactive anticipation and mitigation of potential challenges. Conclusions: Futures studies can significantly enhance medical science by addressing a crucial deficiency in the promotion of democratic participation, facilitating interdisciplinary dialogue, and shaping alternative futures. To further contribute to the development of a new research community in medical futures studies, it is recommended to establish a specialized scientific journal. Additionally, appointing dedicated futurists in decision-making and national strategy, and incorporating futures methods into the medical curriculum could be beneficial. ",

Here, the model receives conflicting instructions, leading to potentially harmful outputs. We hypothesized that handwritten labels and watermarks on histopathological images could act as inadvertent prompt injections, influencing decision-making in histopathology. We conducted a quantitative analysis with a total of 3888 observations on the state-of-the-art VLMs Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4o. We designed various real-world–inspired scenarios in which we investigated how VLMs react to different labels and watermarks if presented with those next to the tissue. All models reached almost perfect accuracies (90 to 100\%) for ground-truth–leaking labels and abysmal accuracies (0 to 10\%) for misleading labels or watermarks, despite baseline accuracies between 30 and 65\% for various multiclass problems. All VLMs relied on the human-provided labels and accepted them as infallible, even when those inputs contained obvious errors. Furthermore, prompt engineering could not mitigate these effects. We therefore provide evidence that labels, pen- and watermarks on histopathological images act as inadvertent prompt injections leading to blatant mistakes in decision-making by state-of-the-art VLMs. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability that could compromise diagnostic accuracy and patient safety in a real-world setting. Future research should focus on developing robust methods to detect and neutralize potential prompt injections. This case study investigates how handwritten labels and watermarks on histopathological images can unintentionally act as prompt injections, misleading state-of-the-art vision–language models such as GPT-4o and Claude. The findings reveal that these models often treat such visual text as authoritative, resulting in inaccurate outputs that highlight a critical vulnerability in medical AI systems. }

abstract = { Generative AI in health care is rapidly enlarging the already substantial environmental footprint of this sector. The massive energy needs, water consumption, metal use, and e-waste generation of AI are jeopardizing the carbon neutrality targets of large technology companies and health systems worldwide. Individuals, health systems, governments, and international organizations have an opportunity to shape an AI market that aligns with societal needs and human values, through cocreation with public and private partners. Urgent action is needed to ensure that the benefits of health AI exceed its detrimental environmental impacts. }

abstract = { In the United States, the economic and social costs of untreated mental health conditions continue to escalate, with barriers to access due to workforce shortages, long wait times, and high referral rates. Technological innovations, including large language models and generative artificial intelligence, can most effectively bridge these gaps if they are focused on optimizing the early stages of mental health care — screening, assessment, triage, and treatment planning. By automating and standardizing initial patient assessments, these tools could empower primary care providers. Critically, technology-enabled solutions stand to bridge the research-to-practice gap when it comes to dimensional models of mental health disorders. These technologies could revolutionize real-world intakes by providing general access to leading evidence-based models of mental health case conceptualization, currently leveraged by only a small percentage of specialists. (Funded by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program grant number, DGE-213989.) A perspective on applying technology to alleviate the current mental health workforce shortage by focusing on the initial stages of mental health treatment for both primary care providers — for whom over 70\% of visits involve a mental health component — and mental health professionals. }

abstract = {Permeation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into health care tests traditional understandings of what patients should be told about their care. Despite the general importance of informed consent, decision support tools (eg, automatic electrocardiogram readers, rule-based risk classifiers, and UpToDate summaries) are not usually discussed with patients even though they affect treatment decisions. Should AI tools be treated similarly? The legal doctrine of informed consent requires disclosing information that is material to a reasonable patientâ€™s decision to accept a health care service, and evidence suggests that many patients would think differently about care if they knew it was guided by AI. In recent surveys, 60\% of US adults said they would be uncomfortable with their physician relying on AI, 70\% to 80\% had low expectations AI would improve important aspects of their care, only one-third trusted health care systems to use AI responsibly, and 63\% said it was very true that they would want to be notified about use of AI in their care.},

We address this question through analysing a contemporary hype in a technology marketing context: digital healthcare. Our aim is to trace how market actors create, support and evaluate a market hype; how hype and market investments are related; and whether hype contributes to irreversibilities in shaping emerging market forms and categories. Our study indicates that hypes contribute tangibly to producing the market, not least by channelling financial, symbolic and material market investments. Furthermore, by highlighting how socio-economic, technological and policy promises become affectively loaded through circulation, we add a novel dimension to existing insights into the socio-cognitive construction of markets. We caution technology marketers, policymakers and investors against blindly following technology hype, especially when it encourages companies to engage in market investment that is unhinged from broader systems and societal, ethical or economic concerns.},

               applicability and precision of a ring-type cuffless blood
               pressure (BP) measurement device, CART-I Plus, compared to
               conventional 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). METHODS:
               Forty patients were recruited, and 33 participants were included
               in the final analysis. Each participant wore both CART-I Plus
               and ABPM devices on the same arm for approximately 24 hours. BP
               estimation from CART-I Plus, derived from photoplethysmography
               (PPG) signals, were compared with the corresponding ABPM
               measurements. RESULTS: The CART-I Plus recorded systolic blood
               pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values of
               131.4$\pm$14.1/81.1$\pm$12.0, 132.7$\pm$13.9/81.9$\pm$11.9, and
               128.7$\pm$14.6/79.3$\pm$12.2 mmHg for 24-hour, daytime, and
               nighttime periods respectively, compared to ABPM values of
               129.7$\pm$11.7/84.4$\pm$11.2, 131.9$\pm$11.6/86.3$\pm$11.1, and
               124.5$\pm$13.6/80.0$\pm$12.2 mmHg. Mean differences in SBP/DBP
               between the two devices were 1.74$\pm$6.69/-3.24$\pm$6.51 mmHg,
               0.75$\pm$7.44/-4.41$\pm$7.42 mmHg, and
               4.15$\pm$6.15/-0.67$\pm$5.23 mmHg for 24-hour, daytime, and
               nighttime periods respectively. Strong correlations were also
               observed between the devices, with r=0.725 and r=0.750 for
               transitions in SBP and DBP from daytime to nighttime,
               respectively (both p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The CART-I Plus
               device, with its unique ring-type design, shows promising
               accuracy in BP estimation and offers a potential avenue for
               continuous BP monitoring in clinical practice. TRIAL

  abstract  = "Abstract Objective Digital health apps and patient portals are
               proposed as part of the drive from `analogue to digital' care
               for the NHS 10 Year Plan. Without mitigation strategies, digital
               inequalities could arise as a result and more evidence is needed
               to understand how to mitigate this. Methods As part of an
               equalities impact assessment, a retrospective cross-sectional
               analysis was conducted examining patient portal activation among
               patients invited to outpatient appointments at two large
               south-east London Hospital Trusts between May 1st and November
               1st, 2024. Results 503,688 patients invited to attend
               outpatients during the study period, 52.7\% of patients invited
               to attend outpatients had activated the patient portal.
               Availability of email contact details were strongest determinant
               for likelihood of onboarding (OR 10.86; CI 10.60-11.12).
               Multivariate logistic regression models showed the following
               groups were less likely to activate the patient portal. Men
               (odds ratio 0.84 (CI:0.83--0.85), extremes of age (71-80 years
               or 11-20 years), those mixed or undefined ethnicity OR 0.58 (CI
               0.57-- 0.59), black ethnicities OR 0.62 (CI 0.61--0.64) or
               un-recorded ethnicities OR 0.72 (CI 0.7-- 0.74) and those with
               highest degree of socio-economically deprivation (IMD group 1)
               OR 0.68 (CI 0.65--0.72). Conclusion This large scale roll-out of
               a digital health portal provide empirical evidence of factors
               which drive digital inequalities for patients of two major
               London NHS Trusts. The observed disparities across demographic
               and socioeconomic dimensions and simple reliable digital contact
               mechanisms highlight the risk that digital healthcare
               initiatives may inadvertently produce new types of inequalities.
               What is the paper about? Were there inequalities in activation
               of the patient portal, MyChart, in the Apollo programme, by
               demographic characteristics of the patients? Yes. Table 1 Were
               the observed inequalities attributable to confounding? No. In a
               multivariate logistic regression, the inequalities persisted
               across all variables. Figure 1 Could the inequalities be
               explained by differential access to email and mobile phones
               across the groups? For several variables, adjusting for the
               presence of email address and mobile phone number attenuated the
               strength of the relationship with Patient Portal activation. It
               did not remove the effect for any variable and the relationship
               with ethnicity was barely affected. Figure 2",

  abstract = "Background: Teledermatology consultations offer the advantage of
              rapid diagnosis and care. Since 2019, our institute at the
              University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf has been part of an
              interdisciplinary team for teledermatology support in German
              prisons as an alternative to extramural transports of patients.
              Objective: This study aims to analyze the benefits and
              limitations of teledermatology for patients with limited access
              to medical specialties. Methods: We conducted a descriptive
              cross-sectional analysis of 651 teleconsultations from prisons
              from February 2020 to April 2023. All cases were performed in a
              store-and-forward (asynchronous mode) and optional hybrid live
              (synchronous) consultation for the patient or in-house staff.
              Results: The main advantage of this case processing was the
              avoidance of external transport. Of the 651 teleconsultations,
              608 (93.4\%) could be finalized with telemedical support and 43
              (6.6\%) required additional workup, including verifications of
              the type of tumors (n=22, 51\%), which needed biopsies, and open
              cases that were inflammatory (n=11, 26\%) or involved infectious
              skin conditions (n=5, 12\%). Digital imaging of the skin lesions
              improved with the experience of the personnel but remained a
              challenge, with the photo quality depending on the technical
              devices or available broadband supply. Conclusions: Hybrid
              teledermatology consultation represents an effective and
              resource-saving method of providing specialized care to patients
              in situations with limited access to medical specialties. The
              video consultations with experts and exchange of knowledge about
              the cases presented opened the opportunity to support and train
              intramural colleagues. One of the main challenges remains the
              quality of digital imaging and transmission.",

              daily lives. However, realizing this potential requires careful

              authors' experiences and perspectives on the development and
              implementation of DHTTs, addressing both established practices
              and controversial topics. This article offers a practical guide
              organized into 10 recommendations derived from a
              multidisciplinary lecture series and associated workshop
              discussions on ``Digital Health and Digital Biomarkers'' held at
              the University of Luxembourg in 2023-2024. Key messages include
              the need to understand specific health care challenges, form
              interdisciplinary teams, incorporate patient feedback, select
              appropriate measurement technologies, ensure data integration and
              interoperability, apply advanced data science techniques, use
              scalable designs and open standards, comply with regulatory
              requirements, and maintain continuous evaluation and improvement.
              While the guide highlights essential practices, it also addresses
              contentious issues such as balancing innovation with regulatory
              compliance, addressing ethical concerns in artificial
              intelligence adoption, managing privacy versus the need for
              comprehensive data integration and open science, and managing the
              financial sustainability of DHTTs. The authors argue that digital
              health's greatest potential lies in its ability to provide
              participatory and personalized care, but this requires a delicate
              balance between technological advances and ethical, legal, and
              social implications. Overall, this workshop-derived viewpoint
              aims to help health care professionals, engineers, developers,
              and researchers not only adopt best practices but also address
              and resolve the controversial aspects inherent in the development

However, to our knowledge, impacts of AI-based draft radiological reporting remain unstudied in clinical settings.To prospectively evaluate the association of radiologist use of a workflow-integrated generative model capable of providing draft radiological reports for plain radiographs across a tertiary health care system with documentation efficiency, the clinical accuracy and textual quality of final radiologist reports, and the model’s potential for detecting unexpected, clinically significant pneumothorax.This prospective cohort study was conducted from November 15, 2023, to April 24, 2024, at a tertiary care academic health system. The association between use of the generative model and radiologist documentation efficiency was evaluated for radiographs documented with model assistance compared with a baseline set of radiographs without model use, matched by study type (chest or nonchest). Peer review was performed on model-assisted interpretations. Flagging of pneumothorax requiring intervention was performed on radiographs prospectively.The primary outcomes were association of use of the generative model with radiologist documentation efficiency, assessed by difference in documentation time with and without model use using a linear mixed-effects model; for peer review of model-assisted reports, the difference in Likert-scale ratings using a cumulative-link mixed model; and for flagging pneumothorax requiring intervention, sensitivity and specificity.A total of 23 960 radiographs (11 980 each with and without model use) were used to analyze documentation efficiency. Interpretations with model assistance (mean [SE], 159.8 [27.0] seconds) were faster than the baseline set of those without (mean [SE], 189.2 [36.2] seconds) (P = .02), representing a 15.5\% documentation efficiency increase. Peer review of 800 studies showed no difference in clinical accuracy (χ2 = 0.68; P = .41) or textual quality (χ2 = 3.62; P = .06) between model-assisted interpretations and nonmodel interpretations. Moreover, the model flagged studies containing a clinically significant, unexpected pneumothorax with a sensitivity of 72.7\% and specificity of 99.9\% among 97 651 studies screened.In this prospective cohort study of clinical use of a generative model for draft radiological reporting, model use was associated with improved radiologist documentation efficiency while maintaining clinical quality and demonstrated potential to detect studies containing a pneumothorax requiring immediate intervention. This study suggests the potential for radiologist and generative AI collaboration to improve clinical care delivery.},

	abstract="Background: Evidence-based tube feeding (TF) weaning involves reducing the volume of tube feeds to induce hunger, with interdisciplinary monitoring to allow for proactive medical, nutritional, and behavioral intervention as needed. This can be done outpatient; however, the current standard of care requires a high degree of medical monitoring and care coordination, which can be challenging to implement. The CHAMP App is a mobile app designed for remote patient monitoring of children born with congenital heart conditions who are at high risk for medical morbidity and mortality. The CHAMP App remote patient monitoring program would be ideally suited to improve medical monitoring and care coordination. Objective: This study aims to determine the feasibility of adapting the CHAMP App for children ready to wean from TF. Methods: We used the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework as a formative tool and conducted a case study beta test. Results: The level of complexity for the digital innovation's adaptation supported a high likelihood of success for the TF population. Most issues were simple, such as expanding the types of data that could be entered into the app, and some were more complicated, for instance, training all relevant staff to use and maintain the technology. The case study beta test was conducted with ``Greyson'', a 10-month old child weaning from TF (name changed for confidentiality). Once a week, the team reviewed the parent-entered data and communicated with Greyson's parents, recommending a 25{\%} reduction in tube feeding each week. With the CHAMP App facilitating 2-way communication between the family and the team, Greyson successfully transitioned from receiving 30{\%} of his feeds orally and 70{\%} via tube feeding to 100{\%} oral feedings over the course of 1 month in a home setting. Conclusions: The CHAMP App is likely to be incredibly valuable in TF weaning. The NASSS framework helped identify key considerations for adapting the CHAMP App for TF weaning at a Midwestern children's hospital. Interviews with the health care team highlighted issues like data entry expansion and staff training. The framework confirmed TF weaning as a suitable application with no major barriers. The CHAMP App successfully supported a test patient, Greyson, in weaning from his feeding tube. It may improve access, communication efficiency, and satisfaction among families and health care teams while reducing costs and enhancing safety monitoring. The app could also make TF weaning more accessible to families with lower health literacy. ",

               this scarce implementation.PurposeTo summarize facilitators and
               barriers among clinicians affecting the use of prognostic models

               Collection, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
               from inception until February 2024.Study SelectionEligible
               studies included those providing clinicians' perspectives on the
               use of prognostic models in acute neurologic care.Data
               ExtractionData were extracted concerning study characteristics,
               study aim, data collection and analysis, prognostic models,
               participant characteristics, facilitators, and barriers. Risk of
               bias was assessed using the Qualsyst tool.Data SynthesisFindings
               were structured around the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use
               of Technology framework. Identified facilitators included
               improved communication with patients and surrogate decision
               makers (n = 9), reassurance of clinical judgment (n = 6)
               perceived improved patient outcomes (n = 4), standardization of
               care (n = 4), resource optimization (n = 3), and extension of
               clinical knowledge (n = 3). Barriers included perceived
               misinterpretation during risk communication (n = 3), mistrust in
               data (n = 3), perceived reduction of clinicians' autonomy (n =
               3), and ethical considerations (n = 2). In total, 15 studies
               were included, with all but 1 demonstrating good methodological
               quality. None were excluded due to poor quality
               ratings.LimitationsThis review identifies limitations, including
               study heterogeneity, exclusion of gray literature, and the
               scarcity of evaluations on model
               implementation.ConclusionsUnderstanding facilitators and
               barriers may enhance prognostic model development and
               implementation. Bridging the gap between development and
               clinical use requires improved collaboration among researchers,
               clinicians, patients, and surrogate decision
               makers.HighlightsThis is the first systematic review to
               summarize published facilitators and barriers affecting the use
               of prognostic models in acute neurologic care from the
               clinicians' perspective.Commonly reported barriers and
               facilitators were consistent with several domains of the Unified
               Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model, including
               effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating
               conditions, with the focus on the performance expectancy
               domain.Future implementation research including collaboration
               with researchers from different fields, clinicians, patients,
               and their surrogate decision makers may be highly valuable for

              access to clinical documents which also resulted in new
              challenges for clinicians, with some spending over 50\% of their
              time on non-clinical tasks. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
              offer promise for reducing this burden, most implementations

               EMR physician champions from 20 solo/small group practices to
               understand different types of EMR users and their EMR-related
               costs and benefits. Results: Interviewees differed greatly in
               the EMR-related benefits they generated. These differences were
               associated with how they used the EMR, and the amount of effort
               they invested in making changes to complement EMR use. We
               defined five types of physician EMR users: Viewers, Basic Users,
               Strivers, Arrivers, and System Changers. The majority of

               engage patients in their health and health care. The My
               HealtheVet Pilot, the initial personal health record of the US
               Department of Veterans Affairs, allowed patients and their
               delegates to view and download content in their electronic
               health record, including clinical notes, laboratory tests, and
               imaging reports. OBJECTIVE: A qualitative study with purposeful
               sampling sought to examine patients' views and experiences with
               reading their health records, including their clinical notes,
               online. METHODS: Five focus group sessions were conducted with
               patients and family members who enrolled in the My HealtheVet
               Pilot at the Portland Veterans Administration Medical Center,
               Oregon. A total of 30 patients enrolled in the My HealtheVet
               Pilot, and 6 family members who had accessed and viewed their
               electronic health records participated in the sessions. RESULTS:
               Four themes characterized patient experiences with reading the
               full complement of their health information. Patients felt that
               seeing their records positively affected communication with
               providers and the health system, enhanced knowledge of their
               health and improved self-care, and allowed for greater
               participation in the quality of their care such as follow-up of
               abnormal test results or decision-making on when to seek care.
               While some patients felt that seeing previously undisclosed
               information, derogatory language, or inconsistencies in their
               notes caused challenges, they overwhelmingly felt that having
               more, rather than less, of their health record information
               provided benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and their delegates had
               predominantly positive experiences with health record

               Viewing their records appears to empower patients and enhance

              As DL increasingly permeates the field of medical imaging, the
              urgency to critically evaluate the fairness of benchmark public
              datasets used to train them grows. Our thorough investigation
              reveals a multifaceted bias problem, encompassing issues such as
              lack of demographic representativeness, limited diversity in
              clinical conditions depicted, and variability in US technology
              used across datasets. We argue that these biases may
              significantly influence DL model performance, which may lead to
              inequities in healthcare outcomes. To address these challenges,
              we recommend a multilayered approach. This includes promoting
              practices that ensure data inclusivity, such as diversifying data
              sources and populations, and refining model strategies to better
              account for population variances. These steps will enhance the

               positive care effects in scientific studies. Since the empirical
               exploration of DiGA cost-effectiveness remains largely
               uncharted, this study pioneers the methodology of cohort-based
               state-transition Markov models to evaluate DiGA for depression.
               As health states, we define mild, moderate, severe depression,
               remission and death. Comparing a future scenario where 50\% of
               patients receive supplementary DiGA access with the current
               standard of care reveals a gain of 0.02 quality-adjusted life
               years (QALYs) per patient, which comes at additional direct
               costs of ~1536 EUR per patient over a five-year timeframe.
               Influencing factors determining DiGA cost-effectiveness are the
               DiGA cost structure and individual DiGA effectiveness. Under
               Germany's existing cost structure, DiGA for depression are yet

	abstract = {Background Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50\% of clinical time. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting.Methods We retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based adjudication and expert human review.Results The top diagnosis of Doctronic and clinician matched in 81\% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2\% of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI performance was superior in 36.1\%, and human performance was superior in 9.3\%; the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases.Conclusions In this first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians. These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems can achieve comparable clinical decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare workforce shortages.Competing Interest StatementAll authors are equity owners of Doctronic Inc.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee of Doctronic Research Group gave ethical approval for this work.

	abstract="Background: Digital health literacy describes an individual's ability to use digital information and tools to improve their own health. Understanding how digital health literacy varies across populations could help improve health equity. However, the determinants of digital health literacy have been scarcely evaluated. Objective: This study aims to assess the levels of digital health literacy in 4 countries (United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Germany) and explore potential associations between digital health literacy and demographic characteristics and self-perceived health status. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was disseminated to participants from the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, and Sweden in December 2020. Digital health literacy was self-reported using the validated eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS; range: 0-40); low digital health literacy has been previously defined as an eHEALS score<26. Participant characteristics collected were sex, age group, ethnicity, country, and perceived overall health status. A multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to explore associations between these variables and digital health literacy. Results: A total of 6331 participants were included (51.7{\%} female, n=3272). The mean eHEALS score was 29.2 (SD 6.8). Participant age, sex, health status, and country of residence were included in the final multivariable model. Compared to the 45- to 54-year age group, the 55 years and older age group had lower digital health literacy ($\beta$=--1.0; 95{\%} CI --1.4 to --0.5; P<.001), while digital health literacy was higher in those aged 25-34 years ($\beta$=0.9; 95{\%} CI 0.3-1.5; P=.002) and 35-44 years ($\beta$=0.6; 95{\%} CI 0.1-1.2; P=.03). Better health status was associated with greater digital health literacy ($\beta$=0.3; 95{\%} CI 0.2-0.4; P<.001). Compared to participants from Germany, those from the United Kingdom ($\beta$=2.1; 95{\%} CI 1.7-2.5; P<.001) and Sweden ($\beta$=2.9; 95{\%} CI 2.4-3.4; P<.001) had higher digital health literacy scores, while there was no difference with Italian participants (P=.399). Sex and ethnicity did not have any significant effect on digital health literacy. Conclusions: This study found significant variations in digital health literacy by age, health status, and country of residence. Targeted educational programs for vulnerable groups, particularly those of older age and poorer health status, are essential. Policies fostering accessible digital health solutions and mitigating health technology--related uncertainties for these populations are crucial for achieving optimal health outcomes. ",

  abstract  = "Early studies of large language models (LLMs) in clinical
               settings have largely treated artificial intelligence (AI) as a
               tool rather than an active collaborator. As LLMs now demonstrate
               expert-level diagnostic performance, the focus shifts from
               whether AI can offer valuable suggestions to how it can be
               effectively integrated into the diagnostic workflow of
               physicians. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=70
               clinicians) to evaluate the value of employing a custom GPT
               system designed to engage collaboratively with clinicians on
               diagnostic reasoning challenges. The collaborative design began
               with independent diagnostic assessments from both the clinician
               and the AI. These were then combined in an AI-generated
               synthesis that integrated the two perspectives, highlighting
               points of agreement and disagreement and offering commentary on
               each. We evaluated two workflow variants: one where the AI
               provided an initial opinion (AI-first), and another where it
               followed the assessment by clinicians (AI-second). Clinicians
               using either collaborative workflow outperformed those using
               traditional tools, achieving average accuracies of 85\%
               (AI-first) and 82\% (AI-second), compared to 75\% with

    abstract = {The use of large language models (LLMs) is growing for both clinicians and patients. While researchers and clinicians have explored LLMs to manage patient portal messages and reduce burnout, there is less documentation about how patients use these tools to understand clinical notes and inform decision-making. This proof-of-concept study examined the reliability and accuracy of LLMs in responding to patient queries based on an open visit note.In a cross-sectional proof-of-concept study, 3 commercially available LLMs (ChatGPT 4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5) were evaluated using 4 distinct prompt seriesâ€”Standard, Randomized, Persona, and Randomized Personaâ€”with multiple questions, designed by patients, in response to a single neuro-oncology progress note. LLM responses were scored by the note author (neuro-oncologist) and a patient who receives care from the note author, using an 8-criterion rubric that assessed Accuracy, Relevance, Clarity, Actionability, Empathy/Tone, Completeness, Evidence, and Consistency. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the performance of each LLM across all prompts.Overall, the Standard and Persona-based prompt series yielded the best results across all criterion regardless of LLM. Chat-GPT 4o using Persona-based prompts scored highest in all categories. All LLMs scored low in the use of Evidence.This proof-of-concept study highlighted the potential for LLMs to assist patients in interpreting open notes. The most effective LLM responses were achieved by applying Persona-style prompts to a patientâ€™s question.Optimizing LLMs for patient-driven queries, and patient education and counseling around the use of LLMs, have potential to enhance patient use and understanding of their health information.Large language models (LLMs) are tools powered by artificial intelligence that can write text responses based on questions. They are becoming more popular among patients and doctors. While doctors are exploring how these tools can help manage tasks like responding to patient messages, thereâ€™s less research on how patients might use LLMs to understand their medical notes or make health decisions.â€ƒIn this proof-of-concept study, we tested 3 different LLMs to see how well they could answer patient questions about a doctorâ€™s progress note from a neuro-oncology visit (a type of care for brain tumors). Patients created the questions, and the answers from the LLMs were graded by both the doctor who wrote the note and a patient using 8 criteria, such as accuracy, clarity, and tone.â€ƒWe found that responses were best when the LLMs were given â€œPersona-styleâ€ prompts, meaning the tool was asked to answer as if it were a doctor.â€ƒThis research shows that LLMs could help patients better understand their health information, but offering assistance to patients to use these tools wisely is key to making them helpful.},

	abstract="Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be the leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. Aiming to reduce the risk of CVD development and better manage them, an increasing number of individuals are adopting mobile health (mHealth) apps and wearable devices (wearables). These technologies provide critical insights into heart health and fitness, supporting users to monitor their lifestyle behaviors and adhere to preventative medication. Objective: In this review, we aimed to investigate the current state of mHealth apps and wearables designed for cardiovascular health, with a specific focus on the DACH region (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland). We assessed the benefits these technologies provide to clinicians and patients, particularly in addressing unmet needs like sex-specific symptoms, while also examining their potential integration into the broader health care ecosystem. Methods: To identify heart health apps, a keyword search was performed on both the Swiss Apple App Store and Google Play Stores. A separate search was performed on Google to identify heart health wearables. The identified apps and wearables were evaluated using the foundational and contextual criteria of the sociotechnical framework for assessing patient-facing eHealth tools. Results: After filtering out apps and wearables that did not meet our inclusion criteria, 20 apps and 22 wearables were included in the review. While all the apps were available in the DACH region, only 30{\%} (6/20) were specifically designed for these countries. Only 25{\%} (5/20) of the apps included sex-specific information; 40{\%} (8/20) provided information from evidence-based research, 35{\%} (7/20) provided general health information without academic and clinical references, and 25{\%} (5/20) did not include any evidence-based or general health information. While 20{\%} (4/20) of the included apps had clinical integration features such as clinician dashboards, only 10{\%} (2/20) had the potential to effectively enhance clinician workflows. Privacy policies were present in 95{\%} (19/20) of the apps, with 75{\%} (15/20) adhering to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations; 1 app had no data protection policy. Only 20{\%} (4/20) of the apps were medically certified. For wearables, only 9{\%} (2/22) were tailored to the DACH region, and 40{\%} (9/22) addressed women's health. While around 60{\%} (13/22) offered features to support clinical integration, only 9{\%} (2/22) had the potential to improve clinical workflows. More than half (12/22) of the wearables were medically certified, and 77{\%} (17/22) referenced scientific or peer-reviewed research. All wearables included a privacy policy. Conclusions: While many mHealth tools for cardiovascular health are available, only a few provide meaningful value to both patients and clinicians or have the potential to integrate effectively into the health care system. Women's sex-specific needs are often overlooked, and the benefits for clinicians are limited. In addition, mHealth apps largely lack robust evidence, whereas wearables showed comparatively stronger support through evidence-based and medical certification. ",

	abstract="Background: Digitalization is steadily advancing on a global scale, exerting a profound influence on health care systems. To facilitate acceptance of the digital transformation, guiding principles emphasize the need for digital health structures to be person-centered and promote high-quality care. This paper examines the implementation challenges within the German health care system, with a particular focus on how change initiatives engage with existing infrastructures and organizational modes of health care delivery. This approach provides a framework for analyzing how established infrastructure determines new developments while also highlighting the procedural dynamics of change and the integration of innovations within existing information infrastructures. These established infrastructures are referred to as the installed base. Objective: The aim of the study is to examine the installed base encountered by the digital transformation within the German health care system by investigating information exchange practices among general practitioners (GPs) and their communication with other health care actors. Methods: A mixed methods study including a quantitative survey and semistructured qualitative interviews was conducted. The study sample consisted of all publicly accessible GP practices (N=1348) situated in the state of Brandenburg, Germany. The survey captured demographic data, communication practices, and perceived barriers to digitalization. The interviews explored experiences with digital applications. Quantitative data were analyzed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), and qualitative data were managed and analyzed in MAXQDA (VERBI Software GmbH) through content analysis. Results: A total of 250 questionnaires (response rate 18.5{\%}) and 10 interviews with GPs were included in the analysis. GPs primarily use the telephone (n=138, 55.2{\%}, SD 24.64), fax (n=109, 43.9{\%}, SD 25.40), or post (n=50, 20.2{\%}, SD 9.46) to exchange information. Newer digital communication channels such as messenger applications (n=2, 0.8{\%}, SD 0.72) and Communication in the Medical Sector (n=1, 0.5{\%}, SD 0.97) play a minor role. We identified three intertwined clusters displaying diverse barriers to the digitalization of GPs' communication practices: (1) incompatibility issues and technical immaturity, (2) lack of knowledge and technical requirements, and (3) additional technical, financial, and time-related burdens. These barriers were perceived as significant deterrents to the adoption of digital tools, with older GPs more reliant on analog systems and more likely to view digitalization as a source of frustration. Conclusions: Newly established communication channels in the German health care system compete with the existing information infrastructure, which is deeply integrated into GPs' practice routines and care processes. However, this installed base has been largely overlooked in digital transformation initiatives. While newer channels hold potential, they often malfunction and are incompatible with long-established, individualized GP workflows. Addressing these issues rather than imposing coercive measures is crucial for increasing adoption. Incorporating health care providers' perspectives and aligning new channels with established routines can prevent frustration and facilitate a smoother digital transformation. ",

Search engines transformed health information access, and LLMs offer a new avenue for answering laypeople's questions. Objective: We aimed to compare the frequency of use and attitudes toward LLMs and search engines as well as their comparative relevance, usefulness, ease of use, and trustworthiness in responding to health queries. Methods: We conducted a screening survey to compare the demographics of LLM users and nonusers seeking health information, analyzing results with logistic regression. LLM users from the screening survey were invited to a follow-up survey to report the types of health information they sought. We compared the frequency of use of LLMs and search engines using ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests. Lastly, paired-sample Wilcoxon tests compared LLMs and search engines on perceived usefulness, ease of use, trustworthiness, feelings, bias, and anthropomorphism. Results: In total, 2002 US participants recruited on Prolific participated in the screening survey about the use of LLMs and search engines. Of them, 52{\%} (n=1045) of the participants were female, with a mean age of 39 (SD 13) years. Participants were 9.7{\%} (n=194) Asian, 12.1{\%} (n=242) Black, 73.3{\%} (n=1467) White, 1.1{\%} (n=22) Hispanic, and 3.8{\%} (n=77) were of other races and ethnicities. Further, 1913 (95.6{\%}) used search engines to look up health queries versus 642 (32.6{\%}) for LLMs. Men had higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95{\%} CI 1.34-1.99; P<.001) of using LLMs for health questions than women. Black (OR 1.90, 95{\%} CI 1.42-2.54; P<.001) and Asian (OR 1.66, 95{\%} CI 1.19-2.30; P<.01) individuals had higher odds than White individuals. Those with excellent perceived health (OR 1.46, 95{\%} CI 1.1-1.93; P=.01) were more likely to use LLMs than those with good health. Higher technical proficiency increased the likelihood of LLM use (OR 1.26, 95{\%} CI 1.14-1.39; P<.001). In a follow-up survey of 281 LLM users for health, most participants used search engines first (n=174, 62{\%}) to answer health questions, but the second most common first source consulted was LLMs (n=39, 14{\%}). LLMs were perceived as less useful (P<.01) and less relevant (P=.07), but elicited fewer negative feelings (P<.001), appeared more human (LLM: n=160, vs search: n=32), and were seen as less biased (P<.001). Trust (P=.56) and ease of use (P=.27) showed no differences. Conclusions: Search engines are the primary source of health information; yet, positive perceptions of LLMs suggest growing use. Future work could explore whether LLM trust and usefulness are enhanced by supplementing answers with external references and limiting persuasive language to curb overreliance. Collaboration with health organizations can help improve the quality of LLMs' health output. ",

	abstract="Background: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly boosted the implementation of digital services worldwide, it has become increasingly important to understand how these solutions are integrated into professionals' routine work. Professionals who are using the services are key influencers in the success of implementations. To ensure successful implementations, it is important to understand the multiprofessional perspective, especially because implementations are likely to increase even more. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine health and social care professionals' experiences of digital service implementations and to identify factors that support successful implementations and should be considered in the future to ensure that the services are integrated into professionals' routine work. Methods: A qualitative approach was used, in which 8 focus group interviews were conducted with 30 health and social care professionals from 4 different health centers in Finland. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The resulting categories were organized under the components of normalization process theory. Results: Our results suggested 14 practices that should be considered when implementing new digital services into routine work. To get professionals to understand and make sense of the new service, (1) the communication related to the implementation should be comprehensive and continuous and (2) the implementation process should be consistent. (3) A justification for the service being implemented should also be given. The best way to engage the professionals with the service is (4) to give them opportunities to influence and (5) to make sure that they have a positive attitude toward the service. To enact the new service into professionals' routine work, it is important that (6) the organization take a supportive approach by providing support from several easy and efficient sources.  The professionals should also have (7) enough time to become familiar with the service, and they should have (8) enough know-how about the service. The training should be (9) targeted individually according to skills and work tasks, and (10) it should be diverse. The impact of the implementation on the professionals' work should be evaluated. The service (11) should be easy to use, and (12) usage monitoring should happen. An opportunity (13) to give feedback on the service should also be offered.  Moreover, (14) the service should support professionals' work tasks. Conclusions: We introduce 14 practices for organizations and service providers on how to ensure sustainable implementation of new digital services and the smooth integration into routine work. It is important to pay more attention to comprehensive and continuing communication. Organizations should conduct a competence assessment before training in order to ensure proper alignment. Follow-ups to the implementation process should be performed to guarantee sustainability of the service. Our findings from a forerunner country of digitalization can be useful for countries that are beginning their service digitalization or further developing their digital services. ",

	abstract="Background: Digital health technologies, particularly mobile health (mHealth) apps and wearable devices, have emerged as crucial assets in the battle against hypertension. By enabling lifestyle modifications, facilitating home blood pressure monitoring, and promoting treatment adherence, these technologies have significantly enhanced hypertension treatment. Objective: This study aims to explore the perspectives of health care professionals (HCPs) regarding the perceived benefits and barriers associated with the integration of mHealth apps into routine hypertension care. Additionally, strategies for overcoming these barriers will be identified. Methods: Through qualitative analysis via semistructured interviews, general practitioners (n=10), cardiologists (n=14), and nurses (n=3) were purposefully selected between October 2022 and March 2023. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The results unveiled 3 overarching themes highlighting the benefits of mHealth apps in hypertension care from the perspective of HCPs. First, these technologies possess the potential to enhance patient safety by facilitating continuous monitoring and early detection of abnormalities. Second, they can empower patients, fostering autonomy in managing their health conditions, thereby promoting active participation in their care. Lastly, mHealth apps may provide valuable support to medical care by offering real-time data that aids in decision-making and treatment adjustments. Despite these benefits, the study identified several barriers hindering the seamless integration of mHealth apps into hypertension care. Challenges predominantly revolved around data management, communication contexts, daily routines, and system handling. HCPs underscored the necessity for structural and procedural modifications in their daily practices to effectively address these challenges. Conclusions: In conclusion, the effective usage of digital tools such as mHealth apps necessitates overcoming various obstacles. This entails meeting the information needs of both HCPs and patients, tackling interoperability issues to ensure seamless data exchange between different systems, clarifying uncertainties surrounding reimbursement policies, and establishing the specific clinical benefits of these technologies. Active engagement of users throughout the design and implementation phases is crucial for ensuring the usability and acceptance of mHealth apps. Moreover, enhancing knowledge accessibility through the provision of easily understandable information about mHealth apps is essential for eliminating barriers and fostering their widespread adoption in hypertension care.

	abstract="Background: Approximately 262 million people worldwide are affected by asthma, and the overuse of reliever medication---specifically, short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) overuse---is common. This can lead to adverse health effects. A smartphone app, the Asthma app, was developed via a participatory design to help patients gain more insight into their SABA use through monitoring and psychoeducation. Objective: This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility and usability of the app. The preliminary effects of using the app after 3 months on decreasing asthma symptoms and improving quality of life were examined. Methods: A mixed methods study design was used. Quantitative data were collected using the app. Asthma symptoms (measured using the Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test) and the triggers of these symptoms were collected weekly. Quality of life (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) was assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. User experience (System Usability Scale) was measured at all time points, except for baseline. Furthermore, objective user data were collected, and qualitative interviews, focusing on feasibility and usability, were organized. The interview protocol was based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology framework. Qualitative data were analyzed using the Framework Method. Results: The baseline questionnaire was completed by 373 participants. The majority were female (309/373, 82.8{\%}), with a mean age of 46 (SD 15) years, and used, on average, 10 SABA inhalations per week. App usability was rated as good: 82.3 (SD 13.2; N=44) at 3 months. The Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test score significantly improved at 3 months (18.5) compared with baseline (14.8; $\beta$=.189; SE 0.048; P<.001); however, the obtained score still indicated uncontrolled asthma. At 3 months, there was no significant difference in the quality of life. Owing to the high dropout rate, insufficient data were collected at 6 and 12 months and were, therefore, not further examined. User data showed that 335 users opened the app (250/335, 74.6{\%}, were returning visitors), with an average session time of 1 minute, and SABA registration was most often used (7506/13,081, 57.38{\%}). Qualitative data (from a total of 4 participants; n=2, 50{\%} female) showed that the participants found the app acceptable and clear. Three participants stated that gaining insight into asthma and its triggers was helpful. Two participants no longer used the app because they perceived their asthma as controlled and, therefore, did not use SABA often or only used it regularly based on the advice of the pulmonologist. Conclusions: The initial findings regarding the app's feasibility and usability are encouraging. However, the notable dropout rate underscores the need for a cautious interpretation of the results. Subsequent studies, particularly those focusing on implementation, should explore the potential integration of the app into standard treatment practices. ",

    abstract = {A time may be approaching when wise patients demand artificial intelligence (AI)–informed care as a standard of quality. How this expectation will be met remains unclear; indeed, AI may put the health system at a crossroads. Even at this formative stage, and despite limitations, predictive AI and large language models (LLMs) show potential for accurately diagnosing and prognosticating across domains, including medicine, pathology, and radiology.Yet traditional health care organizations (HCOs) grapple with the complexities of AI, from integrating it into rigid electronic health record (EHR) workflows to ensuring fairness and monitoring performance. HCOs are often constrained in innovation by entrenched operational structures. Deploying AI demands rigorous oversight, including surveillance for data drift and shift (ie, changes in data patterns that can degrade model performance), while promoting fairness, transparency, and avoidance of bias. Meanwhile, an emerging direct-to-consumer (DTC) health care market bypasses traditional HCOs. For example, Amazon integrates telehealth, primary care, and pharmacy services into its Prime membership. Additionally, Big Pharma host consumer-facing portals streamlining access to medications and integrating telehealth consultations.},

    abstract = {Adherence to long-term therapies in chronic disease is poor. Traditional interventions to improve adherence are complex and not widely effective. Mobile telephone text messaging may be a scalable means to support medication adherence.To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to assess the effect of mobile telephone text messaging on medication adherence in chronic disease.MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (from database inception to January 15, 2015), as well as reference lists of the articles identified. The data were analyzed in March 2015.Randomized clinical trials evaluating a mobile telephone text message intervention to promote medication adherence in adults with chronic disease.Two authors independently extracted information on study characteristics, text message characteristics, and outcome measures as per the predefined protocol.Odds ratios and pooled data were calculated using random-effects models. Risk of bias and study quality were assessed as per Cochrane guidelines. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.Sixteen randomized clinical trials were included, with 5 of 16 using personalization, 8 of 16 using 2-way communication, and 8 of 16 using a daily text message frequency. The median intervention duration was 12 weeks, and self-report was the most commonly used method to assess medication adherence. In the pooled analysis of 2742 patients (median age, 39 years and 50.3\% [1380 of 2742] female), text messaging significantly improved medication adherence (odds ratio, 2.11; 95\% CI, 1.52-2.93; P \&lt; .001). The effect was not sensitive to study characteristics (intervention duration or type of disease) or text message characteristics (personalization, 2-way communication, or daily text message frequency). In a sensitivity analysis, our findings remained robust to change in inclusion criteria based on study quality (odds ratio, 1.67; 95\% CI, 1.21-2.29; P = .002). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 62\%) across clinical trials. After adjustment for publication bias, the point estimate was reduced but remained positive for an intervention effect (odds ratio, 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.18-2.39).Mobile phone text messaging approximately doubles the odds of medication adherence. This increase translates into adherence rates improving from 50\% (assuming this baseline rate in patients with chronic disease) to 67.8\%, or an absolute increase of 17.8\%. While promising, these results should be interpreted with caution given the short duration of trials and reliance on self-reported medication adherence measures. Future studies need to determine the features of text message interventions that improve success, as well as appropriate patient populations, sustained effects, and influences on clinical outcomes.},

The CDA is an ANSI approved document architecture for exchange of clinical information using XML. In phase I of the SCIPHOX project the proposal specifies the use of the CDA as a generalized international standard in the national context of discharge and referral letters in Germany. The specification defines how to use the CDA header and associated vocabularies by providing a translation and interpretation of the CDA header tags and provides a solution for taking local needs (insurance information etc.) into account.}

	abstract = {Introduction
	Immunization information systems (IISs) are highly effective for increasing vaccination rates but information about how primary care physicians use them is limited.
	Methods
	Pediatricians, family physicians (FPs), and general internists (GIMs) were surveyed by e-mail and mail from January 2015 to April 2015 from all states with an existing IIS. Providers were recruited to be representative of national provider organization memberships. Multivariable log binomial regression examined factors associated with IIS use (October 2015–April 2016).
	Results
	Response rates among pediatricians, FPs, and GIMs, respectively, were 75% (325/435), 68% (310/459), and 63% (272/431). A proportion of pediatricians (5%), FPs (14%), and GIMs (48%) did not know there was a state/local IIS; 81%, 72%, and 27% reported using an IIS (p<0.0001). Among those who used IISs, 64% of pediatricians, 61% of FPs, and 22% of GIMs thought the IIS could tell them a patient’s immunization needs; 22%, 29%, and 51% did not know. The most frequently reported major barriers to use included the IIS not updating the electronic medical record (29%, 28%, 35%) and lack of ability to submit data electronically (22%, 27%, 31%). Factors associated with lower IIS use included FP (adjusted risk ratio=0.85; 95% CI=0.75, 0.97) or GIM (adjusted risk ratio=0.33; 95% CI=0.25, 0.42) versus pediatric specialty and older versus younger provider age (adjusted risk ratio=0.96; 95 CI%=0.94, 0.98).
	Conclusions
	There are substantial gaps in knowledge of IIS capabilities, especially among GIMs; barriers to interoperability between IISs and electronic medical records affect all specialties. Closing these gaps may increase use of proven IIS functions including decision support and reminder/recall.}

	abstract = {Background. WeChat is the most widely and frequently used mobile social media in China and has profoundly integrated into the daily life of many Chinese people. A variety of medicine-related information may be found on WeChat. As users of WeChat, doctors often access health-related information and even provide a variety of medical services or participate in various types of mobile communication with patients. Objective. This study is the first attempt to quantitatively explore the approaches by doctors of acquiring medical knowledge using Internet resources especially social media such as WeChat to access knowledge. Methods. A self-administered questionnaire was designed, distributed, collected, and analyzed utilizing the online survey tool Sojump. WeChat was adopted to randomly release the questionnaires using snowball sampling and collect the results after a certain amount of time. Results. 292 valid questionnaires out of 314 questionnaires by clinical doctors were analyzed. Regarding the current status of accessing medical knowledge among doctors, more than 60\% of the doctors regularly used the Internet to search for medical knowledge, 19.86\% used WeChat as a channel to acquire medical knowledge, and only 23.97\% were satisfied with acquiring medical knowledge through the Internet. Regarding the frequency of WeChat usage, nearly 40\% of the doctors accessed WeChat more than 20 times per day and over 70\% used WeChat for over half an hour every day. Regarding the status of accessing medical knowledge through WeChat, nearly half (47.26\%) of the doctors stated that they often read professional medical articles on WeChat and the most common channel is friends’ moment sharing and public account subscriptions, with selection rates of 59.93\% and 60.27\%, respectively. The most desirable mode of acquiring medical knowledge through WeChat was the following: “professional medical knowledge from peers, with a reminder.” Conclusion. WeChat has become a nonnegligible means of acquiring medical knowledge for busy Chinese physicians in a mobile environment. Further evaluation and improvement of the quality of medical knowledge on WeChat are needed. The recommendation of individualized articles through social media may become another contributing factor for doctors to acquire medical knowledge effectively and efficiently.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate the potential of deep learning for automatically delineating (segmenting) laryngeal cancer superficial extent on endoscopic images and videos. Methods A retrospective study was conducted extracting and annotating white light (WL) and Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) frames to train a segmentation model (SegMENT-Plus). Two external datasets were used for validation. The model's performances were compared with those of two otolaryngology residents. In addition, the model was tested on real intraoperative laryngoscopy videos. Results A total of 3933 images of laryngeal cancer from 557 patients were used. The model achieved the following median values (interquartile range): Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) = 0.83 (0.70–0.90), Intersection over Union (IoU) = 0.83 (0.73–0.90), Accuracy = 0.97 (0.95–0.99), Inference Speed = 25.6 (25.1–26.1) frames per second. The external testing cohorts comprised 156 and 200 images. SegMENT-Plus performed similarly on all three datasets for DSC (p = 0.05) and IoU (p = 0.07). No significant differences were noticed when separately analyzing WL and NBI test images on DSC (p = 0.06) and IoU (p = 0.78) and when analyzing the model versus the two residents on DSC (p = 0.06) and IoU (Senior vs. SegMENT-Plus, p = 0.13; Junior vs. SegMENT-Plus, p = 1.00). The model was then tested on real intraoperative laryngoscopy videos. Conclusion SegMENT-Plus can accurately delineate laryngeal cancer boundaries in endoscopic images, with performances equal to those of two otolaryngology residents. The results on the two external datasets demonstrate excellent generalization capabilities. The computation speed of the model allowed its application on videolaryngoscopies simulating real-time use. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the role of this technology in surgical practice and resection margin improvement. Level of Evidence III Laryngoscope, 134:2826–2834, 2024},

Semistructured interviews were conducted with 24 internists and family medicine physicians identified via snowball sampling. Interviews were conducted July through November 2018.

Participants described substantial changes in medical practice due to electronic communication, including perceived patient expectations to receive rapid responses to portal secure messages. They described portal secure messaging as useful for building relationships with patients, but also reported that electronic message management has created new stressors, including erosion of work-life boundaries and anxiety associated with unlimited inbox volume. Individual PCPs used a diverse array of strategies, including multitasking during and outside work and delegating to medical assistants. Chiefs described group-level strategies, including reserving clinic time for inbox management, coverage systems for vacation and sick days, physician-to-physician training, and interdisciplinary teams to share messaging work.Individual physicians and local practice groups have developed a wide array of strategies for electronic inbox management. The volume of electronic messages and PCPs’ perceptions that patients expect rapid responses have created new stressors in primary care practice. Medical groups and health systems can support PCPs by facilitating knowledge transfer among physicians about inbox management strategies and further developing team structures for inbox coverage.},

	Secure messaging is a relatively new addition to health information technology (IT). Several studies have examined the impact of secure messaging on (clinical) outcomes but very few studies have examined the impact on workflow in primary care clinics. In this study we examined the impact of secure messaging on workflow of clinicians, staff and patients.
	Methods
	We used a multiple case study design with multiple data collections methods (observation, interviews and survey).
	Results
	Results show that secure messaging has the potential to improve communication and information flow and the organization of work in primary care clinics, partly due to the possibility of asynchronous communication. However, secure messaging can also have a negative effect on communication and increase workload, especially if patients send messages that are not appropriate for the secure messaging medium (for example, messages that are too long, complex, ambiguous, or inappropriate). Results show that clinicians are ambivalent about secure messaging. Secure messaging can add to their workload, especially if there is high message volume, and currently they are not compensated for these activities. Staff is −especially compared to clinicians- relatively positive about secure messaging and patients are overall very satisfied with secure messaging. Finally, clinicians, staff and patients think that secure messaging can have a positive effect on quality of care and patient safety.
	Conclusion
	Secure messaging is a tool that has the potential to improve communication and information flow. However, the potential of secure messaging to improve workflow is dependent on the way it is implemented and used.}

	abstract="Background: Following a 2010-2011 pilot intervention in which a limited sample of primary care doctors offered their patients secure Web-based portal access to their office visit notes, the participating sites expanded OpenNotes to nearly all clinicians in primary care, medical, and surgical specialty practices. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the ongoing experiences and perceptions of patients who read ambulatory visit notes written by a broad range of doctors, nurses, and other clinicians. Methods: A total of 3 large US health systems in Boston, Seattle, and rural Pennsylvania conducted a Web-based survey of adult patients who used portal accounts and had at least 1 visit note available in a recent 12-month period. The main outcome measures included patient-reported behaviors and their perceptions concerning benefits versus risks. Results: Among 136,815 patients who received invitations, 21.68{\%} (29,656/136,815) responded. Of the 28,782 patient respondents, 62.82{\%} (18,081/28,782) were female, 72.90{\%} (20,982/28,782) were aged 45 years or older, 76.94{\%} (22,146/28,782) were white, and 14.30{\%} (4115/28,782) reported fair or poor health. Among the 22,947 who reported reading 1 or more notes, 3 out of 4 reported reading them for 1 year or longer, half reported reading at least 4 notes, and 37.74{\%} (8588/22,753) shared a note with someone else. Patients rated note reading as very important for helping take care of their health (16,354/22,520, 72.62{\%}), feeling in control of their care (15,726/22,515, 69.85{\%}), and remembering the plan of care (14,821/22,516, 65.82{\%}). Few were very confused (737/22,304, 3.3{\%}) or more worried (1078/22,303, 4.83{\%}) after reading notes. About a third reported being encouraged by their clinicians to read notes and a third told their clinicians they had read them. Less educated, nonwhite, older, and Hispanic patients, and individuals who usually did not speak English at home, were those most likely to report major benefits from note reading. Nearly all respondents (22,593/22,947, 98.46{\%}) thought Web-based access to visit notes a good idea, and 62.38{\%} (13,427/21,525) rated this practice as very important for choosing a future provider. Conclusions: In this first large-scale survey of patient experiences with a broad range of clinicians working in practices in which shared notes are well established, patients find note reading very important for their health management and share their notes frequently with others. Patients are rarely troubled by what they read, and those traditionally underserved in the United States report particular benefit. However, fewer than half of clinicians and patients actively address their shared notes during visits. As the practice continues to spread rapidly in the United States and internationally, our findings indicate that OpenNotes brings benefits to patients that largely outweigh the risks. ",

	ABSTRACT = {The healthcare landscape is facing serious changes driven by digitalization and its VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) conditions. These disrupt the stability of the old order and its static routines. In addition, the global pandemic, technological advances, and patients’ desire for customer rights are reinforcing the need for an accelerated paradigm shift in established healthcare organizations. However, most healthcare organizations are still struggling to close the digitalization gap. They are unprepared to evolve into dynamic VUCA service organizations. To help healthcare organizations to better understand and adapt to the new conditions, we propose an IT-based multi-perspective analysis process enabling holistic understanding and decision-making to derive customized digitalization strategies. To achieve this, it is essential to develop a semantic layer of knowledge mapping and integration. This article introduces the GOLD Framework and its corresponding IT-tool support to derive a holistic understanding based on selecting and connecting suitable methods/theories and guiding the users in their correct use. The required formalization of the IT-tool support ensures consistency and is the basis for continuous improvement. The approach covers the complete process, from sensing new opportunities and/or threats to seizing organization-specific strategies to transforming towards digitally enabled service organizations. Its novelty is threefold: (1) It offers a new level of shared understanding and stakeholder alignment by making the holistic dependencies visible and tangible; (2) it guides the diverse stakeholders step by step; (3) and is based on a standardized approach which however also enables and supports the customization of steps and guidance to better suit the targeted domain and its needs.},

  abstract="Background: The status of the digitalization of companies and institutions is usually measured using maturity models. However, the concept of maturity in general practice is currently unclear, and herewith we examine the question of how maturity can be measured. There is a lack of empirical work on the dimensions and subcategories of digital maturity that provide information on the assessment framework. Objective: The aim of the study was to answer the question of how many and which dimensions and subcategories describe digital maturity in general practice. Methods: An explorative, qualitative research design based on semistructured expert interviews was used to investigate the dimensions of digital maturity. Twenty experts from various areas of the health care sector (care providers, interest groups, health care industry, and patient organizations) were interviewed. The interviews were analyzed based on a content-structuring analysis according to Kuckartz and R{\"a}diker using MAXQDA software (VERBI GmbH). Results: In total, 6 dimensions with a total of 26 subcategories were identified. Of these, 4 dimensions with a total of 16 subcategories (1) digitally supported processes, (2) practice staff, (3) organizational structures and rules, and (4) technical infrastructure and were deductively linked to digital maturity. In addition to the use of digital solutions, digital maturity included, for example, individual, organizational, and technical capabilities and resources of the medical practice. The 2 further dimensions, (5) benefits and outcomes and (6) external framework conditions of the medical practice, were identified inductively with a total of 10 subcategories. Digital maturity was associated with the beneficial use of digitalization, for example, with efficiency benefits for the practice, and external framework conditions were associated with influencing factors such as the local patient situation in the medical practice. Conclusions: The results indicate that digital maturity is a multidimensional construct that is associated with many dimensions and variables. It is a holistic approach with human, organizational, and technical factors and concerns the way digitalization is used to shape patient care and processes. Furthermore, it is related to the maturity of the organizational environment as well as the benefits of a digitalized medical practice; however, this still needs to be confirmed. To measure the level of digital maturity in outpatient care as accurately as possible, maturity models should therefore be multilayered and take external influencing factors into account. Future research should statistically validate the identified dimensions. At the same time, correlations and dependencies between the measurement dimensions and their subcategories should be analyzed.

	abstract = {Purpose
	The impact of the ambulatory electronic health record (EHR) on physician productivity is poorly understood. Fear of productivity loss remains a major concern for practitioners and health care delivery organizations and inhibits system adoption. This study describes the changes in physician productivity after the implementation of a commercially available ambulatory EHR system in a large academic multi-specialty physician group.
	Methods
	Weill Cornell faculty members implemented on the EpicCare (Epic Systems) EHR between 2001 and 2007 were identified as potential study participants. Monthly visit volume, charges, and work relative value units (wRVUs) were compared pre and post each provider's EHR implementation go-live date. Practitioners who lacked at least 6 months of pre- and post-implementation visit volume and charge data were excluded. Practitioners who did not meet pre-determined system proficiency metrics were additionally identified and became the basis of a non-adopter comparison group.
	Results
	203 physicians met criteria for the analysis. The eligible providers were divided into an adopter and non-adopter cohort based on system proficiency benchmarks. Those practitioners who adopted the EHR had a statistically significant increase in average monthly patient visit volume of 9 visits per provider per month. The non-adopter cohort's visit volume was statistically unchanged. Both the EHR adopters and non-adopters had statistically significant increases (22% and 16% respectively) in average monthly charges in the post-implementation period. Average monthly wRVUs were statistically unchanged in the non-adopter cohort, but showed a positive and statistically significant increase of 12 wRVUs per provider per month for the adopter group. The EHR adoption group showed an incremental increase in productivity once practitioners achieved 6 or more months experience with the EHR, consistent with a “ramp-up” period. A multivariable regression model did not reveal any association between the post-EHR implementation change in wRVUs and several potential confounding variables, including baseline provider average monthly visit volume and wRVUs, date of system adoption, and specialty categorization.
	Conclusion
	Provider productivity, as measured by patient visit volume, charges, and wRVUs modestly increased for a cohort of multi-specialty providers that adopted a commercially available ambulatory EHR. The productivity gain appeared to become even more pronounced after several months of system experience. This objective data may help persuade apprehensive practitioners that EHR adoption need not harm productivity. The baseline differences in productivity metrics for the adopters and non-adopters in our study suggest that there are fundamental differences in these groups. Further characterizing these differences may help predict EHR adoption success and guide future implementation strategies.}

	abstract="Background: Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) using web-based diabetes management platforms has demonstrated promise in managing type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the effectiveness of such systems incorporating algorithm-guided insulin titration has not been extensively studied in Asian populations. Objective: This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the ALRT telehealth solution---a US Food and Drug Administration--cleared, web-based platform that integrates SMBG with algorithm-driven insulin dose adjustments---in improving glycemia in insulin-treated T2D. Methods: This 24-week, pre-post intervention study enrolled 25 adults with T2D (mean age 58.9, SD 7.0 y; n=14, 56{\%} male) on twice-daily premixed insulin. Inclusion criteria included a baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level between 7.5{\%} to 9.9{\%} (58‐86 mmol/mol), a BMI ≤40 kg/m{\texttwosuperior}, and experience with SMBG. Participants uploaded twice-daily SMBG data weekly via a mobile app, which generated insulin titration recommendations based on a predefined algorithm. Physicians reviewed and approved the recommendations, which were then communicated back to participants via the app. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c level from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in fasting plasma glucose, insulin dose, hypoglycemia incidence, and SMBG adherence. Results: Participants achieved significant reductions in HbA1c level from 8.6{\%} (70 mmol/mol) at baseline to 7.4{\%} (57 mmol/mol) at 24 weeks (P<.001), with reductions of 0.8{\%} and 0.4{\%} in the first and second 12 weeks, respectively. Fasting plasma glucose decreased from 8.7 (SD 2.0) mmol/L to 7.1 (SD 1.4) mmol/L (P<.001). Mean total daily insulin dose increased modestly from 0.73 (SD 0.31) units/kg/day to 0.79 (SD 0.34) units/kg/day (P=.007). Participants demonstrated high adherence, completing 97.3{\%} (327/336) of prescribed SMBG measurements. During the study, 48{\%} (12/25) of participants experienced at least 1 hypoglycemia episode, predominantly mild hypoglycemia (85/96, 88.5{\%}; glucose 3.0‐3.9 mmol/L). Hypoglycemia episodes increased from 24 during weeks 0‐12 to 72 during weeks 13‐24. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia requiring external assistance. BMI increased slightly from 29.0 (SD 3.6) kg/m{\texttwosuperior} to 29.5 (SD 3.6) kg/m{\texttwosuperior} (P=.03), reflecting a modest weight gain associated with improved glycemia. Conclusions: In conclusion, patients with insulin-treated T2D initiated on a web-based glucose monitoring system with algorithm-guided dosing recommendations showed significant improvement in glycemic control compared to baseline. High adherence rates underscore the feasibility of integrating algorithm-guided insulin titration into routine care. While hypoglycemia incidence rose slightly, episodes were predominantly mild, and no severe events occurred. This intervention shows promise for broader adoption in T2D management, particularly in resource-constrained settings. ",

  abstract="Background: Digital technologies are shaping medicine and public health. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes toward and the use of digital technologies for health-related purposes using a nationwide survey. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using a panel sample of internet users selected from the general population living in Germany. Responses to a survey with 28 items were collected using computer-assisted telephone interviews conducted in October 2020. The items were divided into four topics: (1) general attitudes toward digitization, (2) COVID-19 pandemic, (3) physical activity, and (4) perceived digital health (eHealth) literacy measured with the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS; sum score of 8=lowest to 40=highest perceived eHealth literacy). The data were analyzed in IBM-SPSS24 using relative frequencies. Three univariate multiple regression analyses (linear or binary logistic) were performed to investigate the associations among the sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, and household income) and digital technology use. Results: The participants included 1014 internet users (n=528, 52.07{\%} women) aged 14 to 93 years (mean 54, SD 17). Among all participants, 66.47{\%} (674/1014) completed up to tertiary (primary and secondary) education and 45.07{\%} (457/1017) reported a household income of up to 3500 Euro/month (1 Euro=US {\$}1.18). Over half (579/1014, 57.10{\%}) reported having used digital technologies for health-related purposes. The majority (898/1014, 88.56{\%}) noted that digitization will be important for therapy and health care, in the future. Only 25.64{\%} (260/1014) reported interest in smartphone apps for health promotion/prevention and 42.70{\%} (433/1014) downloaded the COVID-19 contact-tracing app. Although 52.47{\%} (532/1014) reported that they come across inaccurate digital information on the COVID-19 pandemic, 78.01{\%} (791/1014) were confident in their ability to recognize such inaccurate information. Among those who use digital technologies for moderate physical activity (n=220), 187 (85.0{\%}) found such technologies easy to use and 140 (63.6{\%}) reported using them regularly (at least once a week). Although the perceived eHealth literacy was high (eHEALS mean score 31 points, SD 6), less than half (43.10{\%}, 400/928) were confident in using digital information for health decisions. The use of digital technologies for health was associated with higher household income (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95{\%} CI 1.11-1.47). The use of digital technologies for physical activity was associated with younger age (OR 0.95, 95{\%} CI 0.94-0.96) and more education (OR 1.22, 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.46). A higher perceived eHealth literacy score was associated with younger age ($\beta$=--.22, P<.001), higher household income ($\beta$=.21, P<.001), and more education ($\beta$=.14, P<.001). Conclusions: Internet users in Germany expect that digitization will affect preventive and therapeutic health care in the future. The facilitators and barriers associated with the use of digital technologies for health warrant further research. A gap exists between high confidence in the perceived ability to evaluate digital information and low trust in internet-based information on the COVID-19 pandemic and health decisions. ",

First, an initial list was created based on findings from a scoping review and expert consultations. A multidisciplinary and geographically diverse panel of 211 experts from 79 countries and territories was convened for a 2-round, modified Delphi survey conducted between December 2022 and July 2023, with an a priori consensus level of 70\%. The framework structure, wordings, and learning outcomes with marginal percentage of agreement were discussed and determined in a consensus meeting organized on September 8, 2023, and subsequent postmeeting qualitative feedback. In total, 211 experts participated in round 1, 149 participated in round 2, 12 participated in the consensus meeting, and 58 participated in postmeeting feedback.The DECODE framework uses 3 main terminologies: domain, competency, and learning outcome. Competencies were grouped into 4 domains: professionalism in digital health, patient and population digital health, health information systems, and health data science. Each competency is accompanied by a set of learning outcomes that are either mandatory or discretionary. The final framework comprises 4 domains, 19 competencies, and 33 mandatory and 145 discretionary learning outcomes, with descriptions for each domain and competency. Six highlighted areas of considerations for medical educators are the variations in nomenclature, the distinctiveness of digital health, the concept of digital health literacy, curriculum space and implementation, the inclusion of discretionary learning outcomes, and socioeconomic inequities in digital health education.This evidence-informed and consensus-guided framework will play an important role in enabling medical institutions to better prepare future physicians for the ongoing digital transformation in health care. Medical schools are encouraged to adopt and adapt this framework to align with their needs, resources, and circumstances.},

    abstract = {In case anyone has not noticed, health care is undergoing rapid digital transformation increasingly fueled by artificial intelligence (AI). Not surprisingly, the best way to prepare future physicians for this reality remains uncertain; the tools and technologies that will dominate in the next decade are evolving rapidly. In the face of this uncertainty, international frameworks like the Digital Health Competencies in Medical Education (DECODE) offer welcome guidance. After preliminary work, more than 200 international experts participated in a 2-round Delphi process, ultimately yielding a final DECODE framework with 19 competencies, 33 mandatory learning outcomes, and 145 discretionary learning outcomes covering a broad range of topics from bias in machine learning algorithms to digital health literacy. This comprehensive framework is intended to support medical educators from diverse geographies in equipping their students to navigate current and emerging technologies. A companion perspective to keep in mind, and well served by this framework, is the need to prepare our students for a future where patients are cocreators of their care, enabled by technology and empowered with reliable information.},

abstract="Background: Early weight loss is an established predictor for treatment outcomes in weight management interventions for people with obesity. However, there is a paucity of additional, reliable, and clinically actionable early predictors in weight management interventions. Novel blended-care weight management interventions combine coach and app support and afford new means of structured, continuous data collection, informing research on treatment adherence and outcome prediction. Objective: Against this backdrop, this study analyzes app engagement as a predictor for weight loss in large-scale, real-world, blended-care interventions. We hypothesize that patients who engage more frequently in app usage in blended-care treatment (eg, higher logging activity) lose more weight than patients who engage comparably less frequently at 3 and 6 months of intervention. Methods: Real-world data from 19,211 patients in obesity treatment were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were treated with 3 different blended-care weight management interventions, offered in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Germany by a digital behavior change provider. The principal component analysis identified an overarching metric for app engagement based on app usage. A median split informed a distinction in higher and lower engagers among the patients. Both groups were matched through optimal propensity score matching for relevant characteristics (eg, gender, age, and start weight). A linear regression model, combining patient characteristics and app-derived data, was applied to identify predictors for weight loss outcomes. Results: For the entire sample (N=19,211), mean weight loss was --3.24{\%} (SD 4.58{\%}) at 3 months and --5.22{\%} (SD 6.29{\%}) at 6 months. Across countries, higher app engagement yielded more weight loss than lower engagement after 3 but not after 6 months of intervention (P3 months<.001 and P6 months=.59). Early app engagement within the first 3 months predicted percentage weight loss in Switzerland and Germany, but not in the United Kingdom (PSwitzerland<.001, PUnited Kingdom=.12, and PGermany=.005). Higher age was associated with stronger weight loss in the 3-month period (PSwitzerland=.001, PUnited Kingdom=.002, and PGermany<.001) and, for Germany, also in the 6-month period (PSwitzerland=.09, PUnited Kingdom=.46, and PGermany=.03). In Switzerland, higher numbers of patients' messages to coaches were associated with higher weight loss (P3 months<.001 and P6 months<.001). Messages from coaches were not significantly associated with weight loss (all P>.05). Conclusions: Early app engagement is a predictor of weight loss, with higher engagement yielding more weight loss than lower engagement in this analysis. This new predictor lends itself to automated monitoring and as a digital indicator for needed or adapted clinical action. Further research needs to establish the reliability of early app engagement as a predictor for treatment adherence and outcomes. In general, the obtained results testify to the potential of app-derived data to inform clinical monitoring practices and intervention design. ",

	abstract = {Background The extension to which digital technologies are employed to promote the delivery of high-quality healthcare is known as Digital Maturity. Individuals{\textquoteright} and systems{\textquoteright} digital maturity are both necessary to ensure a successful, scalable and sustainable digital transformation in healthcare. Digital maturity in primary care has been scarcely evaluated.Objectives This study assessed the digital maturity - as a whole and in its dimensions - in General Practice and evaluated how participants{\textquoteright} demographic characteristics, practice characteristics and features of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) use are associated with digital maturity.Methods General Practitioners (GPs) across 20 countries completed an online questionnaire between June and September 2020. Demographic data, practice characteristics and features of EHRs use were collected. Digital maturity was evaluated through a framework built upon usage, resources and ability (divided in this study in its collective and individual components), interoperability, general evaluation methods and impact of digital technologies. Each dimension was rated as 1 or 0. The digital maturity score is the sum of the six dimensions and ranges from 0 to 6 (maximum digital maturity). Multivariable linear regression was used to model the total score, while multivariable logistic regression was used to model the probability of meeting each dimension of the score.Results 1,600 GPs (61\% female, 68\% Europeans) participated. GPs had a median digital maturity of 4 (P25-P75: 3-5). Positive associations with digital maturity were found for: being male (B=0.18 [95\%CI 0.01;0.36]), use of EHRs for longer periods (B=0.45 [95\%CI 0.35;0.54]) and higher frequencies of access to EHRs (B=0.33 [95\%CI 0.17;0.48]). Practising in a rural setting was negatively associated with digital maturity (B=-0.25 [95\%CI -0.43;-0.08]). Usage (90\%) was the most acknowledged dimension while interoperability (47\%) and use of best practice general evaluation methods (28\%) were the least. Shorter durations of EHRs use were negatively associated with all digital maturity dimensions (aOR from 0.09 to 0.77).Conclusions Our study demonstrated notable factors that impact digital maturity and exposed discrepancies in digital transformation across healthcare settings. It provides a roadmap for policymakers to develop more efficacious interventions to hasten and take the best advantage of digital transformation in General Practice.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project is supported by a grant from the European General Practice Research Network.

abstract = {Introduction
The purpose of this study was to evaluate if an electronic health record (EHR) self-scheduling function was associated with changes in mammogram completion for primary care patients who were eligible for a screening mammogram using U.S. Preventive Service Task Force recommendations.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study (September 1, 2014–August 31, 2019, analyses completed in 2022) using a difference-in-differences design to examine mammogram completion before versus after the implementation of self-scheduling. The difference-in-differences estimate was the interaction between time (pre-versus post-implementation) and group (active EHR patient portal versus inactive EHR patient portal). The primary outcome was mammogram completion among all eligible patients, with completion defined as receiving a mammogram within 6 months post-visit. The secondary outcome was mammogram completion among patients who received a clinician order during their visit.
Results
The primary analysis included 35,257 patient visits. The overall mammogram completion rate in the pre-period was 22.2% and 49.7% in the post-period. EHR self-scheduling was significantly associated with increased mammogram completion among those with an active EHR portal, relative to patients with an inactive portal (adjusted difference 13.2 percentage points [95% CI 10.6–15.8]). For patients who received a clinician mammogram order at their eligible visit, self-scheduling was significantly associated with increased mammogram completion among patients with an active EHR portal account (adjusted difference 14.7 percentage points, [95% CI 10.9–18.5]).
Conclusions
EHR-based self-scheduling was associated with a significant increase in mammogram completion among primary care patients. Self-scheduling can be a low-cost, scalable function for increasing preventive cancer screenings.}

Objective: This study aimed to explore how remote consultations impact on contracted general practitioner (GP) practices and how GPs perceive the implications of this uptake for the overall health care system. Methods: In total, 5 focus groups were conducted with a total of 18 GPs from all 4 health regions of Norway in 2022. The material was subjected to Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis. Results: The analysis yielded six themes: (1) the design of novel effective clinical pathways: remote consultations empower GPs to tailor new effective clinical trajectories, blending modalities to address diverse needs across clinical episodes---from initial triage, through investigations to case closure; (2) increased workday flexibility: remote consultations introduce variability into daily work, allowing GPs to adjust patient contact intensity, and leading to a less stressful work-home balance; (3) erosion of organizational boundaries: easy remote access to GPs appears to reduce patients' tolerance for minor illness and self-care, hindering effective gatekeeping and shifting GPs' focus from proactive to more reactive work, increasing work-related stress; (4) degradation of clinical shrewdness: confronted with an increasing amount of unsorted and trivial remote inquiries, GPs observe challenges in detecting and prioritizing serious cases; (5) dilemmas related to responsibility, ethics, and legislation: remote consultations highlight a tension for contract GPs between legal responsibilities and ethical obligations, with implications for patients with limited health literacy; this may entail suboptimal evaluation or delayed treatment---potentially contributing to increased health care inequity; and (6) retaining clinical core values in a changing world. Overall, GPs affirm that remote consultations have come to stay and describe efforts to effectively manage the advantages and disadvantages inherent in such interactions to safeguard clinical effectiveness and organizational sustainability of primary health care. Conclusions: The widespread adoption of remote consultations in the Norwegian contract GP scheme fundamentally reshapes the dynamics of GP work and the overall health care system. Awareness and proactive management of these changes are essential for maintaining sustainable, high-quality primary health care.},

@ARTICLE{Neunaber_2023,title={Digital Maturity and Its Measurement of General Practitioners: A Scoping Review},year={2023},author={Timo Neunaber and Sven Meister},doi={10.3390/ijerph20054377},pmid={36901387},pmcid={10001864},mag_id={4322742797},journal={International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health},abstract={The work of general practitioners (GPs) is increasingly characterized by digitalization. Their progress in digitalization can be described by the concept of digital maturity and measured using maturity models. The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the state of research on digital maturity and its measurement in primary care, specifically for GPs. The scoping review was conducted according to Arksey and O’Malley, considering the reporting scheme for PRISMA-ScR. For the literature search, we used PubMed and Google Scholar as the main sources of information. A total of 24 international, mostly Anglo-American studies, were identified. The understanding of digital maturity varied widely. In most studies, it was understood in a highly technical way and associated with the adoption of electronic medical records. More recent, but mostly unpublished, studies have attempted to capture overall digital maturity. So far, the understanding of digital maturity of GPs is still very diffuse—the research literature is still in its infancy. Future research should therefore aim to explore the dimensions of digital maturity of GPs to be able to develop a consistent and validated model for measuring digital maturity.}}

METHODS: We inter-viewed EMR physician champions from 20 solo/small group practices to understand different types of EMR users and their EMR-related costs and benefits. RESULTS: Interviewees differed greatly in the EMR-related benefits they generated. These differences were associated with how they used the EMR, and the amount of effort they invested in making changes to complement EMR use. We defined five types of physician EMR users: Viewers, Basic Users, Strivers, Arrivers, and System Changers. The majority of interviewees were Strivers and Arrivers, physicians who have already invested substantial time in numerous process changes that help generate EMR-related benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Incentives and comprehensive support services for facilitating complementary process changes could be important for moving physicians from one user group to another. Additional research is needed to verify this user typology and to further define the relationship between user types and EMR-generated financial and quality benefits.}}

In the light of an apparent lack of empirically based integrated accounts surrounding these issues, this interpretative review aims to provide an overview and extract potentially generalizable findings across settings.    Methods  We conducted a systematic search and critique of the empirical literature published between 1997 and 2010. In doing so, we searched a range of medical databases to identify review papers that related to the implementation and adoption of eHealth applications in organizational settings. We qualitatively synthesized this literature extracting data relating to technologies, contexts, stakeholders, and their inter-relationships.    Results  From a total body of 121 systematic reviews, we identified 13 systematic reviews encompassing organizational issues surrounding health information technology implementations. By and large, the evidence indicates that there are a range of technical, social and organizational considerations that need to be deliberated when attempting to ensure that technological innovations are useful for both individuals and organizational processes. However, these dimensions are inter-related, requiring a careful balancing act of strategic implementation decisions in order to ensure that unintended consequences resulting from technology introduction do not pose a threat to patients.    Conclusions  Organizational issues surrounding technology implementations in healthcare settings are crucially important, but have as yet not received adequate research attention. This may in part be due to the subjective nature of factors, but also due to a lack of coordinated efforts toward more theoretically-informed work. Our findings may be used as the basis for the development of best practice guidelines in this area.}}

Unfortunately, many of these practices are making little effective use of this technology.

This paper describes a model for the assessment and managed change of information management maturity within general practice. The model, known as GPIMM (General Practice Information Maturity Model), which has been developed from related models in fields such as software quality and diffusion of innovation, provides a framework for the assessment of the maturity of information processes within general practice. The model can also be used to define key tasks in terms of training and information strategies to facilitate practice development. The model and its antecedents are described, and it is shown how this model can be used to assess and improve information processes within case study practices. This paper then goes on to examine the health librarians’ role in the process of change and discuss the metaphor of a ‘virtual library’ as a means to shift the agenda from information technology to information itself.}}

Design  Mixed-methods study.  Setting  Manitoba.  Participants  Health care providers and staff in 5 primary care offices.  Methods  Level of EMR adoption was assessed, and field notes from interviews and discussion groups were qualitatively analyzed for common challenges and themes across all sites.  Main findings  Fifty-seven interviews and 4 discussion groups were conducted from November 2011 to January 2012. Electronic medical record adoption scores ranged from 2.3 to 3.0 (out of a theoretical maximum of 5). Practices often scored lower than expected on use of decision support, providing patients with access to their own data, and use of practice-reporting tools. Qualitative analysis showed there were ceiling effects to EMR adoption owing to how the EMR was implemented, the supporting eHealth infrastructure, lack of awareness or availability of EMR functionality, and poor EMR data quality.  Conclusion  Many practitioners used their EMRs as “electronic paper records” and were not using advanced features of their EMRs that could further enhance practice. Data-quality issues within the EMRs could affect future attempts at using these features. Education and quality improvement activities to support data quality and EMR optimization are likely needed to support practices in maximizing their use of EMRs.}}

Physicians differ, however, in their use of this health information technology (IT), and these differences are not well understood. The authors study the differences in individual physicians’ EHR use patterns and identify perceptions of uncertainty as an important new variable in understanding EHR use. Design Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and direct observation of physicians (n=28) working in a multispecialty outpatient care organization. Measurements We identified physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty as an important variable in understanding differences in EHR use patterns. Drawing on theories from the medical and organizational literatures, we identified three categories of perceptions of uncertainty: reduction, absorption, and hybrid. We used an existing model of EHR use to categorize physician EHR use patterns as high, medium, and low based on degree of feature use, level of EHR-enabled communication, and frequency that EHR use patterns change. Results Physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty were distinctly associated with their EHR use patterns. Uncertainty reductionists tended to exhibit high levels of EHR use, uncertainty absorbers tended to exhibit low levels of EHR use, and physicians demonstrating both perspectives of uncertainty (hybrids) tended to exhibit medium levels of EHR use. Conclusions We find evidence linking physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty with EHR use patterns. Study findings have implications for health IT research, practice, and policy, particularly in terms of impacting health IT design and implementation efforts in ways that consider differences in physicians’ perceptions of uncertainty.}}

Extensive literature exists about how to assess the components of digital maturity, but it has not been used to design a comprehensive framework for evaluation. Consequently, the measurement systems that do exist are limited to evaluating digital programs within one service or care setting, meaning that digital maturity evaluation is not accounting for the needs of patients across their care pathways. Objective: The objective of our study was to identify the best methods and metrics for evaluating digital maturity and to create a novel, evidence-based tool for evaluating digital maturity across patient care pathways. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature to find the best methods and metrics for evaluating digital maturity. We searched the PubMed database for all papers relevant to digital maturity evaluation. Papers were selected if they provided insight into how to appraise digital systems within the health service and if they indicated the factors that constitute or facilitate digital maturity. Papers were analyzed to identify methodology for evaluating digital maturity and indicators of digitally mature systems. We then used the resulting information about methodology to design an evaluation framework. Following that, the indicators of digital maturity were extracted and grouped into increasing levels of maturity and operationalized as metrics within the evaluation framework. Results: We identified 28 papers as relevant to evaluating digital maturity, from which we derived 5 themes. The first theme concerned general evaluation methodology for constructing the framework (7 papers). The following 4 themes were the increasing levels of digital maturity: resources and ability (6 papers), usage (7 papers), interoperability (3 papers), and impact (5 papers). The framework includes metrics for each of these levels at each stage of the typical patient care pathway. Conclusions: The framework uses a patient-centric model that departs from traditional service-specific measurements and allows for novel insights into how digital programs benefit patients across the health system.

There have been two major drivers for the HIS investments in healthcare: The ever-increasing burden from chronic disease with costs growing significantly faster and the recognition of the need for greatly improved quality and safety in health delivery. Maturity models (MM) are based on the premises that people, organizations, functional areas and processes evolve through a process of development or growth towards a more advanced maturity, going through a distinct number of levels.

This poses challenges for leaders of digital transformation programmes—most importantly, how to set clear targets in the absence of an agreed basis for assessing current achievements or desired final goals. The rapid, continual emergence of new technologies adds further complexity. Internationally, the most widely used assessment of digital excellence is the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (EMRAM).6HIMSS Legacy WorkgroupHistory of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society.https://www.himss.org/sites/himssorg/files/HIMSSorg/Content/files/HistoryHIMSS_January2013.pdfDate: 2012Date accessed: February 21, 2019Google Scholar This model maps out eight stages, from 0 to 7, for the adoption and utilisation of electronic medical record (EMR) functions culminating with HIMSS Level 7 (no use of paper charts, CPOE/CDSS [Computerized Provider Order Entry and Clinical Decision Support System] used in over 90% of the hospital). HIMSS Level 7 remains an uncommon achievement. For example, despite substantial federal investment through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act,7Blumenthal D Launching HITECH.N Engl J Med. 2010; 362: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar only 6% of US hospitals have achieved HIMSS Level 7.8Cohen JK How many hospitals are on each stage of HIMSS Analytics' EMR adoption model?.https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/ehrs/how-many-hospitals-are-on-each-stage-of-himss-analytics-emr-adoption-model.htmlDate: April 16, 2018Date accessed: February 21, 2019Google Scholar Various related frameworks have also been developed, including the HIMSS Analytics Infrastructure Adoption Model (INFRAM) and the Continuity of Care Maturity Model (CCMM). NHS England has adapted EMRAM, adding dimensions of interoperability, technological readiness, and infrastructure components to create a Digital Maturity Index to assess hospitals' digital capabilities. The key limitations of HIMSS EMRAM (and related approaches) are an almost exclusive focus on technological functionality rather than human and organisational capabilities and a failure to ensure that these are contextualised as enablers of transformation. HIMSS EMRAM also focuses on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of data exchange within hospitals rather than with other health-care organisations or settings such as primary and social care, which is fundamental to the provision of integrated care—often thereby neglecting innovation in service delivery models and social innovation. The portrayal of a single pathway towards excellence, achieved through a series of stages, might also unhelpfully distort priorities. Thus, a hospital could achieve HIMSS EMRAM Level 7 by having a closed-loop prescribing and administration system, but lack expertise in maintaining it or interrogating the data it generates. Additionally the costs of achieving closed-loop prescribing, which might be justified in terms of improving safety within a hospital, might not be the most pressing priority when considering patient pathways across an integrated health service. Although cost is a key driver for procuring digital systems in health care, which might be reinforced by models such as HIMSS EMRAM Level 7, focusing purely on technological capabilities, increasing evidence now also suggests that cost savings are unlikely to materialise and that the introduction of complex systems can have undesired consequences. Improving safety and quality might therefore be more realistic goals. The notion of digital excellence serves an important purpose, providing a vision that can help motivate stakeholders and coordinate activities towards the pursuit of the quadruple aims of improving population health, controlling costs, enhancing patient experience, and improving the working life of health-care providers.9Bodenheimer T Sinsky C From triple to quadruple aim: care of the patient requires care of the provider.Ann Fam Med. 2014; 12: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar However, new frameworks for assessing digital maturity in relation to these complex and often contradictory goals are needed. These frameworks should facilitate setting clear targets and establishing ways to assess progress across diverse providers and settings, while also being agile by allowing targets to be updated throughout this journey. In doing so, we offer an alternative framework of measuring digital excellence where digital maturity can be tailored to the needs of local populations and build upon their existing institutional and technological infrastructures. This approach provides scope for adjustments over time in a context in which goalposts are changing, and where there is no agreed conception of direction and no endpoint (figure).10Pipek V Wulf V Infrastructuring: toward an integrated perspective on the design and use of information technology.J Assoc Inf Sys. 2009; 10: 306-332Google Scholar Our model takes these complexities into account. Here, different settings need to make constant re-assessments of their existing and desired digital state over time as goals, IT solutions, and policies change. This model could involve local providers identifying their own priorities and periodically reassessing these against their locally defined or desired outcomes. Large-scale digital change programmes need to take these localised dimensions of digital maturity into account—for example, by adjusting endpoints of envisioned future states according to local factors. Use of HIMSS Level 7 as a measurement of success for all organisations is likely to lead to disillusionment among those involved as health-care organisations might become frustrated with their local needs not being met and policy makers might become frustrated by mandated targets not being met.

This systematic review aims to identify relevant frameworks and synthesize their recommendations into DHT-specific content to be considered when performing Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) for DHTs that manage chronic noncommunicable disease at home. METHODS Searches were undertaken of Medline, Embase, Econlit, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library (January 2015 to March 2020), and relevant gray literature (January 2015 to August 2020) using keywords related to HTA, evaluation frameworks, and DHTs. Included framework reference lists were searched from 2010 until 2015. The EUNetHTA HTA Core Model version 3.0 was selected as a scaffold for content evaluation. RESULTS Forty-four frameworks were identified, mainly covering clinical effectiveness (n = 30) and safety (n = 23) issues. DHT-specific content recommended by framework authors fell within 28 of the 145 HTA Core Model issues. A further twenty-two DHT-specific issues not currently in the HTA Core Model were recommended. CONCLUSIONS Current HTA frameworks are unlikely to be sufficient for assessing DHTs. The development of DHT-specific content for HTA frameworks is hampered by DHTs having varied benefit and risk profiles. By focusing on DHTs that actively monitor/treat chronic noncommunicable diseases at home, we have extended DHT-specific content to all nine HTA Core Model domains. We plan to develop a supplementary evaluation framework for designing research studies, undertaking HTAs, and appraising the completeness of HTAs for DHTs.}}

Wood},doi={10.3389/fdgth.2021.726095},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={3193547041},journal={null},abstract={Establishing and running remote consultation services is challenging politically (interest groups may gain or lose), organizationally (remote consulting requires implementation work and new roles and workflows), economically (costs and benefits are unevenly distributed across the system), technically (excellent care needs dependable links and high-quality audio and images), relationally (interpersonal interactions are altered) and clinically (patients are unique, some examinations require contact, and clinicians have deeply-held habits, dispositions and norms). Many of these challenges have an under-examined ethical dimension. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Planning and Evaluating Remote Consultation Services (PERCS), built from a literature review and ongoing research. PERCS has 7 domains—the reason for consulting, the patient, the clinical relationship, the home and family, technologies, staff, the healthcare organization, and the wider system—and considers how these domains interact and evolve over time as a complex system. It focuses attention on the organization’s digital maturity and digital inclusion efforts. We have found that both during and beyond the pandemic, policymakers envisaged an efficient, safe and accessible remote consultation service delivered through state-of-the art digital technologies and implemented via rational allocation criteria and quality standards. In contrast, our empirical data reveal that strategic decisions about establishing remote consultation services, allocation decisions for appointment type (phone, video, e-, face-to-face), and clinical decisions when consulting remotely are fraught with contradictions and tensions—for example, between demand management and patient choice—leading to both large- and small-scale ethical dilemmas for managers, support staff and clinicians. These dilemmas cannot be resolved by standard operating procedures or algorithms. Rather, they must be managed by attending to here-and-now practicalities and emergent narratives, drawing on guiding principles applied with contextual judgement. We complement the PERCS framework with a set of principles for informing its application in practice, including education of professionals and patients.}}

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are recommended as an essential part of comprehensive and multidisciplinary evaluation studies on telemedicine applications. For the first time, a systematic review has been conducted investigating the use of PROMs and PREMs in evaluation studies of telemedicine applications covering all application types and medical purposes. OBJECTIVE Our review investigates the following research questions: • In which scenarios were PROMs and PREMs collected for evaluation purposes? • Which PROM/PREM outcome domains have been covered and how often? • Which outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) have been used and how often? • Did the selection and quantity of PROMs and PREMs differ between study types and application types? • Has the use of PROMs and PREMs in evaluation studies changed over time? METHODS We conducted a systematic literature search in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and included studies published from inception until April 2, 2020. We included studies evaluating telemedicine applications with patients as main users; these studies reported PROMs and PREMs within randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled trials, non-controlled trials and feasibility trials in English and German. RESULTS Out of 2671 records identified, 303 studies were included with 22.1% (67/303) feasibility studies, 23.1% (70/303) non-controlled trials, 6.6% (20/303) controlled trials and 48.2% (146/303) RCTs. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (n=310, mean=1.02, SD=1.05), emotional function (n=244, mean=0.81, SD=1.18) and adherence (n=103, mean=0.34, SD=0.53) were the most frequently assessed outcome domains. Self-developed PROMs were used in 21.4% (65/303) of all studies, self-developed PREMs were used in 22.3% (68/303). PROMs (n=884) were assessed more frequently than PREMs (n=234). As the evidence level of the studies increased, the number of PROMs also increased (τ=-0.45) with the number of PREMs decreasing (τ=0.35) at the same time. Since 2000, not only has the number of evaluation studies using PROMs/PREMs increased - the level of evidence and the number of OMIs used have also increased, with the number of PREMs permanently remaining at a lower level compared to the number of PROMs. CONCLUSIONS There have been increasingly more studies, particularly high-evidence studies, which use PROMs and PREMs to evaluate telemedicine applications. PROMs have been used more frequently than PREMs. With an increasing maturity stage of the telemedicine applications and higher evidence level, the use of PROMs increased in line with the recommendations of evaluation guidelines. HRQoL and emotional function were measured in almost all studies. Simultaneously, health literacy as a precondition for using the application adequately - alongside proper training and guidance - was rarely reported. Further efforts should be pursued for the standardization of PROM and PREM collection in evaluation studies of telemedicine applications.}}

Data were transcribed, coded thematically, and then analysed using the Planning and Evaluating Remote Consultation Services (PERCS) framework.With few exceptions, video consultations were either never adopted or soon abandoned in general practice despite a strong policy push, short-term removal of regulatory and financial barriers, and advances in functionality, dependability, and usability of video technologies (though some products remained 'fiddly' and unreliable). The relative advantage of video was perceived as minimal for most of the caseload of general practice, since many presenting problems could be sorted adequately and safely by telephone and in-person assessment was considered necessary for the remainder. Some patients found video appointments convenient, appropriate, and reassuring but others found a therapeutic presence was only achieved in person. Video sometimes added value for out-of-hours and nursing home consultations and statutory functions (for example, death certification).Efforts to introduce video consultations in general practice should focus on situations where this modality has a clear relative advantage (for example, strong patient or clinician preference, remote localities, out-of-hours services, nursing homes).}}

In Finland, the development of eHealth maturity has been systematically studied since 2003, through surveys conducted every 3 years. It has also been monitored in several international studies. The indicators used in these studies examined the availability of the electronic patient record, picture archiving and communication system, health information exchange, and other key eHealth functionalities. Objective The first aim is to study the national development in the maturity level of eHealth in primary health care and specialized care between 2011 and 2020 in Finland. The second aim is to clarify the regional differences in the maturity level of eHealth among Finnish hospital districts in 2020. Methods Data for this study were collected in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020, using web-based questionnaires from the Use of information and communication technology surveys in Finnish health care project. In total, 16 indicators were selected to describe the status of eHealth, and they were based on international eHealth studies and Finnish eHealth surveys in 3 areas: applications, regional integration, and data security and information and communications technology skills. The indicators remain the same in all the study years; therefore, the results are comparable. Results All the specialized care organizations (21/21, 100%) in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 participated in the study. The response rate among primary health care organizations was 86.3% (139/161) in 2011, 88.2% (135/153) in 2014, 85.8% (121/141) in 2017, and 95.6% (130/136) in 2020. At the national level, the biggest developments in eHealth maturity occurred between 2011 and 2014. The development has since continued, and some indicators have been saturated. Primary health care lags behind specialized care organizations, as measured by all the indicators and throughout the period under review. Regionally, there are differences among different types of organizations. Conclusions eHealth maturity has steadily progressed in Finland nationally, and its implementation has also been promoted through various national strategies and legislative changes. Some eHealth indicators have already been saturated and achieved an intensity of use rate of 100%. However, the scope for development remains, especially in primary health care. As Finland has long been a pioneer in the digitalization of health care, the results of this study show that the functionalities of eHealth will be adopted in stages, and deployment will take time; therefore, national eHealth strategies and legislative changes need to be implemented in a timely manner. The comprehensive sample size used in this study allows a regional comparison in the country, compared with previous country-specific international studies.}}

Individual and systemic digital maturity are both necessary to ensure a successful, scalable and sustainable digital transformation in healthcare. However, digital maturity in primary care has been scarcely evaluated. Objectives This study assessed the digital maturity in General Practice (GP) globally and evaluated its association with participants' demographic characteristics, practice characteristics and features of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) use. Methods GPs across 20 countries completed an online questionnaire between June and September 2020. Demographic data, practice characteristics, and features of EHRs use were collected. Digital maturity was evaluated through a framework based on usage, resources and abilities (divided in this study in its collective and individual components), interoperability, general evaluation methods and impact of digital technologies. Each dimension was rated as 1 or 0. The digital maturity score was calculated as the sum of the six dimensions and ranged between 0 to 6 (maximum digital maturity). Multivariable linear regression was used to model the total score, while multivariable logistic regression was used to model the probability of meeting each dimension of the score. Results One thousand six hundred GPs (61% female, 68% Europeans) participated. GPs had a median digital maturity of 4 (P25–P75: 3–5). Positive associations with digital maturity were found with: male gender [ B = 0.18 (95% CI 0.01; 0.36)], use of EHRs for longer periods [ B = 0.45 (95% CI 0.35; 0.54)] and higher frequencies of access to EHRs [ B = 0.33 (95% CI 0.17; 0.48)]. Practicing in a rural setting was negatively associated with digital maturity [ B = −0.25 (95%CI −0.43; −0.08)]. Usage (90%) was the most acknowledged dimension while interoperability (47%) and use of best practice general evaluation methods (28%) were the least. Shorter durations of EHRs use were negatively associated with all digital maturity dimensions (aOR from 0.09 to 0.77). Conclusion Our study demonstrated notable factors that impact digital maturity and exposed discrepancies in digital transformation across healthcare settings. It provides guidance for policymakers to develop more efficacious interventions to hasten the digital transformation of General Practice.}}

We are studying UK general practices as they try to balance remote and in-person care, with recurrent waves of COVID-19 and various post-pandemic backlogs.Mixed-methods (mostly qualitative) case study across 11 general practices. Researchers-in-residence have built relationships with practices and become familiar with their contexts and activities; they are following their progress for two years via staff and patient interviews, documents and ethnography, and supporting improvement efforts through co-design. In this paper, we report baseline data.Reflecting our maximum-variety sampling strategy, the 11 practices vary in size, setting, ethos, staffing, population demographics and digital maturity, but share common contextual features-notably system-level stressors such as high workload and staff shortages, and UK's technical and regulatory infrastructure. We have identified both commonalities and differences between practices in terms of how they: 1] manage the 'digital front door' (access and triage) and balance demand and capacity; 2] strive for high standards of quality and safety; 3] ensure digital inclusion and mitigate wider inequalities; 4] support and train their staff (clinical and non-clinical), students and trainees; 5] select, install, pilot and use technologies and the digital infrastructure which support them; and 6] involve patients in their improvement efforts.General practices' responses to pandemic-induced disruptive innovation appear unique and situated. We anticipate that by focusing on depth and detail, this longitudinal study will throw light on why a solution that works well in one practice does not work at all in another. As the study unfolds, we will explore how practices achieve timely diagnosis of urgent or serious illness and manage continuity of care, long-term conditions and complex needs.}}
